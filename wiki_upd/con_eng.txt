The Satavahanas, beginning with Vashishtiputra Sri Pulomavi (130-158 BC), are considered to be the first Indian local rulers to print portraits of kings on their coins. This tradition comes from the Indo-Greek kings who ruled in the northwest. Satavahana coins provide unpredictable evidence of the chronology of kings, language, and facial expressions (curly hair, large ears, strong lips). They mainly printed lead (verse), copper coins; Their cover silver coins are usually printed on the coins of the Western Kshatriya kings. The coins are adorned with many traditional symbols such as elephants, lions, horses and Chaitya stupas. They also have the "Ujjain symbol" (four circles at the four edges of a + sign). Due to the presence of the Ujjain symbol on the Satavahana coins, the famous mythological emperor Vikramaditya, in whose name the Vikrama era began, is thought to have been the Satavahana emperor.

At present the Pallavas have become the Agnikulakshatriyas and Vanniyakula Kshatriyas of the south. The question of where the Pallavas came from is a matter of controversy for historians. The Nasik inscription states that the Satavahana king Gautamiputra Satakarni desecrated the 'Shakapahlavas'. Based on this, it can be said that the Pallavas were Pharisees and gradually became independent after joining the Satavahanas in the south as part of the Saka-Pahlava-Kamboja tribes' migration. Ancient Tamil texts considered the Pallavas to be pagan

In the second century, a translator came from the north and joined the Satavahanas as an employee. When he married a virgin of the Chutu clan, Chutupallava was born by her. Veerakurbavarma, son of Chutapallava. Due to the ancestry of his grandson Skandamul, Dakshinandhra Desam and the adjoining areas of Karnataka were inherited. After the demise of the Satavahana Empire, Skandamulu succumbed to the pressure of the Ishwaks and sought to expand his country south. He sent his son Kumaravishnu up to Kanchi and he defeated Satyasena and captured Kanchi. After Skandamul, Kumara Vishnu expanded his kingdom and performed Ashvamedha Yagya. During this time the Cholas boomed again and tried to recapture Kanchi. Buddhavarma, the second son of Kumaravishnu, overthrew the Cholas and extinguished their influence. Buddhavarma's eldest son Skandavarma extended his kingdom from Kaveri to the Krishna river, from Praksamudra to the western boundaries of Kuntala. Many of the defeated Cholas during this period joined the Andhra Mandals and held jobs with the Pallavarajas. They became the progenitors of the later Telugu Cholas.

During the reign of Emperor Shah Jahan in 1631, the Mughal Empire was in great wealth, at which time Shah Jahan was filled with grief at the death of his third wife, Mumtaz Mahal, giving birth to their fourteenth child, Gauhara Begum. Mumtaz Mahal, which was in its final stages, asked Shah Jahan to build for itself the most beautiful tomb that no one in the world had ever seen. Shah Jahan agreed to his wife's wish and began construction of the Taj Mahal in 1632, a year after her death. History has it that the love story of Shah Jahan was an inspiration to the Taj Mahal. The main tomb was completed in 1648, and the surrounding buildings and garden were completed in five years.

Room decoration inside the Taj Mahal is much more advanced than traditional decorative elements. The inlay skill here is not Pitra Dura but Lapide (gem related), as the gem is done with precision. The interior room design is an octagon that opens inwards from each door, although only one door facing the garden faces south. The interior rooms are 25 meters long and the "fake" interior dome roof is decorated with a sense of the sun. The eight pistachio arches illuminate the ground level and the exterior space. Under each passage in the middle of the wall the pistachio has a second pistachio on top of it. Balconies or four mid-upper arches from the viewing area, the outer window of each balcony has an intricate grille carved in marble. In addition to the light entering from the balcony curtains, light also enters from the open roofs, which are covered with canopies in the corners. Each room wall is adorned with superior dado sculptural craftsmanship, intricate gemstone inlays, tiles with impeccable engraving, and their design elements reflected throughout the exterior of the building. The empty tombs are bordered by octagonal marble screens or jolly, intricately carved with eight marble slabs. The rest of the surfaces are highly delicately gem-encrusted and wrapped to form the vines, fruits and flowers.

The Taj Mahal has cranellation walls on three sides, with red sandstone walls on one side and a river on the other. On the inside of the walls are garden-facing arches, a symbolic feature of Hindu temples, which were later incorporated into Mughal mosques. Used as a storehouse.

The Taj Mahal was built on a piece of land south of Agra. Shah Jahan gifted a large plot of land in the middle of Agra to Maharaja Jai ​​Singh for this place. To reduce waterlogging, a roughly three-acre area was excavated and filled with soil, raising the site to 50 meters above the river bank. The tomb area was dug and filled with stones to lay the foundation of the tomb. Instead of bamboo, the workers built a gigantic brick kiln at the height of the tomb. The main workers thought it would take years to demolish the lake because it was so large. It appears that Shah Jahan decreed that anyone could take bricks from the well, with which it was dismantled overnight by workers.

Butterflies are a beautiful colorful winged insect. These belong to the order Lepidoptera. The most important aspects of their life - the four stages of life - the egg stage, the larval or caterpillar stage, the pupa stage, which later evolve, are the "butterfly" stage with the colorful wings that emerge as a result of mutation. Mostly butterflies fly during the day and are a sight to behold. Butterflies have become a popular hobby due to the variety of colors on their wings and the "fluttering" flying pattern found in other flying species.

Color is light that has a constant wavelength. Light with different wavelengths comes in different colors. Colors or hues are French, Italian, German, Swedish, Latin, Spanish, English: a feature of objects visible to our eyes. The seven types of colors that are commonly found in nature are called saptavarnas. Different colors depend on the wavelength, reflection, etc. properties of the light. The colors visible to our eyes are approximately between 400 nm and 700 nm. These rays are detected by cone cells in the retina and provide information to the brain. International Colors Day is celebrated on March 21 every year.

The eye is the organ that detects light and transmits information to the brain through the optic nerve. The eye is an important organ in humans. Are mounted on both sides of the human face. These act as a camera in humans and send external appearances to the brain, including colors. Different organisms are structurally eye-catching in ten different designs. It is the most complex of the 96% of these animal species. Eyes that clearly show reflection are found in the creatures Nideria, Mollusca, Cordata, Anelida, and Arthropoda. The simplest eyes of all living things are microbes. They detect the presence of light in the surroundings and only distinguish between light and dark. Based on these, biological circles are determined. Information in complex organisms reaches the brain through cells in the retina of the eyes.

The simplest eyes of all living things are microbes. They detect the presence of light in the surroundings and only distinguish between light and dark. Based on these, biological circles are determined. Information in complex organisms reaches the brain through cells in the retina of the eyes.
The eye is the organ that detects light and transmits information to the brain through the optic nerve. The eye is an important organ in humans. Are mounted on both sides of the human face.

Currently, 12 lakh people in India need corneas. In addition, an additional 40 to 50 thousand people are needed each year. All parts of the eye are well and only the cornea collected by eye donation is implanted in those who are blinded by ovarian damage. Then they can see like everyone else. Those interested in donating an eye can call the Government Comprehensive Hospital where they will come and collect the eye. Those who need them are surgically arranged. All this procedure is done free of cost. The collected eyes are sent to other eye banks if they do not fit the list. Everyone whose cornea is healthy can donate an eye. There is no age limit. Cataract surgery can be performed on people with high blood pressure, diabetics, blindfolds and people with asthma. People living with HIV, AIDS, jaundice, rabies, dog cancer, encephalitis, corneal scarring, retinoblastoma should not donate eyes.

In humans the brain is protected by the skull at the head. The brain is an important center for all the senses. The brain has been shown to have the ability to repair itself on its own. Neurons in the cerebral cortex have also been found to regenerate, changing their shape to suit injuries. The brain is characterized by thinking about what to do, making decisions, and remembering past things. However, recent research has shown that men are more intelligent than women, women are more intelligent than men, and men are more intelligent than women. This has been shown to be due to differences in the structure of neurons in the brain. A meta study conducted by Richard Lynn from 1999 to 2005 found that average intelligence was 3 - 5 points higher in men than in women. Scientists Jackson and Ruston found that boys between the ages of 17 and 18 had a higher intelligence of 3.63 points.

The mouth, muzzle or mouth is located in the lower part of the human face. The front two lips are arranged to open or close the mouth. The back meets the throat. The inside of the mouth is the tongue moving. The upper part of the oral cavity is called the palate. Digestion begins in the mouth. This is where the food is shredded and mixed with saliva. Apart from this it is useful for talking, drinking liquids, smoking cigarettes, inhaling and kissing. Approximately 100 ml in the human mouth. Takes fluid.

The tongue is the part of the mouth that is made entirely of muscle. It helps in chewing and swallowing food. We taste because of the tongue. Saliva always keeps it moist. It also helps us talk. It spreads from the lower teeth to the throat at the base of the mouth. The study of the tongue is called laryngology. Placing pills under the tongue is a medical procedure. The drug dissolves quickly and enters the heart and begins to function very quickly. As soon as a heart attack occurs, the nitroglycerin tablets that are with us work immediately and the pain subsides quickly. Tongue coating is a fungal disease. The tongue appears dry as it dries when the water in the human body is too low. In some neurological diseases the tongue is crooked. Awareness of the disease depends on the side it is turned on. Cancer of the mouth can also come to the tongue. Scientists have developed a device called a brain port that allows blind people to see with their tongue.

The tongue is the part of the mouth that is made entirely of muscle. It helps in chewing and swallowing food. We taste because of the tongue. Saliva always keeps it moist. It also helps us talk. It spreads from the lower teeth to the throat at the base of the mouth. The study of the tongue is called laryngology. Placing pills under the tongue is a medical procedure. The drug dissolves quickly and enters the heart and begins to function very quickly. As soon as a heart attack occurs, the nitroglycerin tablets that are with us work immediately and the pain subsides quickly. Tongue coating is a fungal disease.

The sense organ located in front of the nose or nasal head. The protruding nose protrudes from the center of the human face. There are two nostrils at the bottom of the nose. The upper bouts featured two cutaways, for easier access to the higher frets. The shape of the nose is determined by the ethmoid bone, the cartilage that divides the two nostrils. There are many uses for the word nose in the Telugu language. The nose is called the nose. The bird's face is also called the nose. "Nipple" means the nipples between the breasts. It is said that a man who speaks with a snub nose does not seem to notice. Nose: It is also known as sniffing to soothe pain. Some materials are also said to be perishable. E.g .: pearls are pierced. Nostrils or nostrils. The cord is pierced from the inside of the beak to control powerful animals. This is called a "nose" or "nose". Solochanamu, also known as "mukkaddamu" spectacles.

Digestive system is the part of the body that digests food. It breaks down food into common chemicals so that some of the nutrients in the chemicals can be incorporated into the bloodstream. Nutrients from the bloodstream first reach the liver. The liver adjusts nutrients so that the body gets the energy it needs. Certain chemicals released by the liver can cause food to be digested. Parts of the human digestive system: mouth, esophagus, esophagus, esophagus, gastrointestinal tract, small intestine, large intestine, rectum, anus. The gastrointestinal tract in the human digestive tract as well as the ancillary organs of digestion: tongue, salivary glands, pancreas, liver, gallbladder also removes digestive waste. The digestive system begins in the mouth and ends in the anus (note: digestion ends in the small intestine). Animals / insects such as worms, mammals, birds, fish, and humans all have digestive systems. There are many diseases that affect the digestive system. Gastroenterologists are doctors who study the gastrointestinal tract.

The circulatory system is a blood vessel in the body that supplies good blood to different parts of the body and returns bad blood to the heart. The circulatory system is made up of the heart and blood vessels. It works to transport oxygen and other nutrients to all the organs and tissues in your body. Removes carbon dioxide and waste products. Having a healthy circulatory system is essential for human health. The circulatory system is made up of many parts. The heart This muscular organ works to supply blood throughout the body through blood vessels. Arteries These are the blood vessels that carry oxygenated blood away from the heart. Veins are blood vessels that carry deoxygenated blood to the heart. Capillaries are small blood vessels that facilitate the exchange of oxygen, nutrients, and waste between organs and tissues.

The urinary system, also known as the kidney or urinary tract, contains the kidneys, bladder, and urethra. The purpose of the urinary system is to remove waste from the body, regulate blood volume, blood pressure, regulate electrolyte metabolic levels, and regulate blood pH. The body's drainage system is the urinary tract to eventually excrete urine. The kidneys have an extensive blood supply through the renal arteries, which leave the kidneys through the renal vein. Each kidney contains functional units called nephrons. The blood is filtered, and after further processing, the waste (in the form of urine) is excreted by the kidneys through the kidneys. Tubes made of soft muscle fibers that carry urine toward the bladder. Are stored here and excreted from the body through urination. The female and male urinary system are very similar, differing only in the length of the bladder.

Urination begins inside the functional unit of the kidney, the nephron. Urine then collects with the vessels through the nephrons, a system that collects tubes. These collecting vessels together form small calluses, after which large calluses eventually meet in the renal pelvis. From here, the urine flows from the kidney pelvis to the bladder, transporting the urine into the bladder. The anatomy of the human urinary system differs between males and females at the bladder level. In males, it begins at the internal urethra in the triangle of the bladder, continues through the external urinary orbit, and then becomes the prostatic, membrane, bulbar, and penile urethra. Urine comes out through the flesh of the external bladder. The female bladder is very small, starting at the neck and ending at the vaginal vestibule.

In males, it begins at the internal urethra in the triangle of the bladder, continues through the external urinary orbit, and then becomes the prostatic, membrane, bulbar, and penile urethra. Urine comes out through the flesh of the external bladder. The female bladder is very small, starting at the neck and ending at the vaginal vestibule.
The lungs are the major organs in the respiratory system of some fish and snails, not only in humans but also in other animal species. In mammals, and in most vertebrates, they are located on either side of the heart near the spine. The ribs protect them. Their main function is to pump oxygen from the outside atmosphere into the bloodstream and from there by expelling carbon dioxide. Breathing takes place under the influence of different muscular systems in different organisms. In humans this process is induced by the abdominal cavity. The lungs also produce the air that humans need to speak. Humans have two (left, right) lungs. These are located in the thoracic cavity in the thoracic region. The right lung is larger than the left. The left lung and heart share space on the left side of the urethra. The two lungs together weigh about 1.3 kg. The right lung is heavier than the left.

Physics is the study of matter, its motions, behavior, and relative forces and forces through space-time. Physics is one of the most basic disciplines of science, and the main goal of physics is to understand how the universe behaves. Various examples of physical phenomena Physics combines with many other disciplines, such as bio-physics and quantum chemistry, the boundaries of which are not precisely defined. New ideas in physics often explain the basic approaches studied by other sciences. Indicates new research avenues in academic disciplines such as mathematics and philosophy. Advances in physics often lead to advances in new technologies. For example advances in disciplines such as electromagnetism, solid-state physics, and nuclear physics have led to the development of new products that have dramatically changed modern society, such as television, computers, home appliances, and nuclear weapons; Advances in thermodynamics led to industrial development; And the advancement of mechanics inspired the development of calculus.

In coronavirus, corona means crown. The microbe was named after what appeared to be a crown shape when viewed electronically under a microscope. Corona is derived from the Latin word 'crown'. There are already a total of seven coronaviruses, of which ‘MERS COV’ stands for ‘Middle East Respiratory Syndrome’, a type of virus. The second is ‘SARS COV’ which means ‘Severe Accurate Respiratory Syndrome’. These two types of coronaviruses cause the common cold and fever. These common coronaviruses are transmitted from animal to animal and from animal to human. The most important coronaviruses are SARS and MERS Research has shown that the SARS COV virus can be transmitted from cats to humans. ‘MERS-COV’ has been shown to infect humans from camels. Apart from these, many types of coronaviruses have been shown to be transmitted from animal to animal, and it is unclear how easily they can be transmitted from one person to another.

There are already a total of seven coronaviruses, of which ‘MERS COV’ stands for ‘Middle East Respiratory Syndrome’, a type of virus. The second is ‘SARS COV’ which means ‘Severe Accurate Respiratory Syndrome’. These two types of coronaviruses cause the common cold and fever. These common coronaviruses are transmitted from animal to animal and from animal to human. The most important coronaviruses are SARS and MERS Research has shown that the SARS COV virus can be transmitted from cats to humans. ‘MERS-COV’ has been shown to infect humans from camels. Apart from these, many types of coronaviruses have been shown to be transmitted from animal to animal, and it is unclear how easily they can be transmitted from one person to another.

Fever, cough. There may also be sore throats, sore throats, and headaches. But there is nothing that will necessarily come. When the disease strikes, our body's immune system responds to the infection with a fever and nausea. Our immune system recognizes the virus as an enemy that has entered the body and sends signals to the rest of the body by releasing chemicals called ketokines to fight the virus. In fact, these ketokines are part of our immune system. But it causes tears, aches and fevers. The cough is initially dry due to the agitation of the cells when the corona virus is infected. It does not contain anything like moisture. After a few days, some people get cough and moisture. The virus kills the lung cells and comes out in the form of this moisture. These symptoms can be treated with medications such as paracetamol, which provides complete relaxation of the body and high doses of fluid when the symptoms persist for up to a week. Most will recover by that time.
The coronavirus was first identified on December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, China. As of March 5, 2020, more than 95,000 cases have been diagnosed worldwide. 7,100 of them are serious. Eighty-five countries were affected, with the worst affected countries being Central China, South Korea, Italy and Iran. More than 3,200 people died: nearly 3,000 in China and 275 in other countries. More than 51,000 people recovered. Measures taken by China include hubby lockdown, imposition of curfew in various areas; British cruise ship Diamond Princess quarantined in Japanese waters; Lockdowns were imposed in Italy. Some airports and train stations have set up screening procedures such as temperature checks and health declaration forms. Many countries have issued warnings not to travel to countries such as China, Italy and Iran. All schools in China, Iran, Japan and Italy were closed. According to some statistics, 19 out of every 20 people infected with the corona virus actually recover without being hospitalized. Most of those admitted to the hospital recover after receiving medical treatment, but some are at risk of losing their lives without oxygen or ventilator. According to some research in the UK, dexamethasone was the first drug to have the greatest results in reducing corona mortality, but people should not buy it and treat it on their own. Vaccine development for the coronavirus is still ongoing.

It is one of the main delicacies of Tirupati Venkateswara Swamy. Of all the laddus, the importance of Tirupati laddu is by no means an exaggeration. Because of its taste and aroma there is no laddu in the world. That is why this laddu got a geographical production license. This means that no one should imitate its manufacturing process. Tirupati Laddu is one of the most popular devotional offerings to the devotees. From the 15th century to the early 20th century, the place of laddu in the prasadam in the Tirumala temple was now Vadaku. At that time ‘treaty reports’ (offerings) were finalized for Srivastava. It was during these times that offerings were made to the devotees. At that time there were no dining facilities on the hill. These offerings satisfy the hunger of the devotees. Under the auspices of the East India Company, Mahanthu introduced the sweet pot in the mid-19th century during the management of the Tirumala temple. By the 1940s it had become the same laddu. Laddu has gradually taken the place of Vada and now there is a huge demand for laddu. Special methods are followed for the preparation of this laddu. Ingredients like pure peanut flour, acacia, ghee, raisins, cardamom, cashews, camphor etc. are used to make this prasadam.

The offering given to the devotees is called ' Thiruppongam '. Later Sukhiyam, Appam (1455 AD), Vada (1460 AD), Athirasam (1468 AD) and Manoharapadi (1547 AD) were introduced. None of these except Vada are likely to be stored for more days. There was a high demand for a filter that could be taken to faraway places. When it was discovered, the then Madras government first started selling prasadam at the Srivari temple from 1803. History has it that bundi, which was formed before laddu, has been sold as a sweet treat since. The form of prasadam, which varied in many ways, was finally settled in 1940 as Tirupati Laddu. It is believed that in 1536 AD, the poor Thirumalacharyas of Thallapaka introduced a marriage ceremony with Srivariki and Sridevi Bhudevi in ​​Thirumala. In modern times the Swami is being perpetually married. Since bundi laddu is the Telugu culture at weddings, it has become customary to give bundi laddu free of cost to those who have got married during the nithya kalyana.

In 1933, the British government set up a commission-led governing body to administer the Tirumala Temple. Again, the Hindu Religious Act of 1951 changed all Commissioners to Executive Officers (EOs). In addition, Titidayu set up a board of trustees and appointed a chairman. The law states that the Ewo temple will be administered under the supervision of a board of trustees. The council initiated the development by constructing a stairway at a cost of Rs 26,000 for the convenience of the devotees. The second project they set out on was the Ghat Road. Chelikani said.

Once upon a time, when there was a famine in the country and there was no food to eat due to famine, Gautama Maharshi with his taposhakti arranged for fellow sages and their disciples to be freed from famine and provided with food. Then those sages sent a magic cow with jealousy that Gautama had the taposaktis that they did not have and destroyed Gautama's crops. Gautama struck the cow with a darbha and it died. The Ganges is the river Godavari or Gautami, which Gautama brought to the earth by persuading Lord Shiva to atone for his cow slaughter. He freed the cowherd by flowing this river over the dead cow. That cow had access to heaven. That place is the Gospada Kshetra. This shrine is now the town of Kovvur in the West Godavari district.

There is an interesting story behind this wall which was transformed from "Golla Konda" into Golconda Fort. That is, in 1143, an idol of a goddess was found on a rock mound called Mankala. The news was conveyed to the Kakatiyas who then ruled the area. Soon the king built a clay structure in that holy place. Golconda was an important fort in the kingdom of Oruganti for the Kakatiyas and Musunuri blacksmiths. The Golconda Fort was first captured in 1323 by Ulugh Khan, son of Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq. Golconda was liberated along with Orugallu with the revolution of the Pidapa Musunuri blacksmiths. In 1347, the Musunuri blacksmiths clashed with the Bahmani kingdom, which became the capital of Gulbarga. During the reign of Muhammad Shah, Musunuri Kapaya leader Kaulas sent his son Vinayaka Dev to recapture the fort. But Vinayaka Dev failed in this attempt. In 1361, as a result of a quarrel over the purchase of Persian horses, Muhammad Shah invaded the town of Belam, captured Vinayaka Dev and killed him. On their way back to Gulbarga, Mohammed Shah's soldiers were beaten by a group of men. The Sultan was also seriously wounded. In retaliation, the sultan rallied a large army and went to war against the Kapaya leader. Vijayanagara did not receive any help. The Kapya leader sought the help of the Delhi Sultan. The Sultan of Delhi refused to wage war on his fellow Muslims. He reconciled with the weakened Kapya leader Mohammad Shah. With 300 elephants, 200 horses and Rs 33 lakh, Golconda gave up forever. Azim Humayun headed the Golconda fort and Shah returned to Gulbarga. Thus, in 1364, the Golconda fort fell from the Hindus. Later the Nawabs ruled.

The Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 was a military conflict between India and Pakistan. Pakistan's suspected attack on 11 Indian Air Force air bases on December 3, 1971 is considered Operation Genghis Khan. This suspicion-induced attack marked the beginning of the war. The battle, which lasted only 13 days, is considered one of the shortest in history. During the war, Indian and Pakistani forces clashed in the east and west. The war ended effectively when the Pakistani military forces of the Eastern Command signed the surrender document. To this day, it is probably the first and last of the public surrenders. Following the surrender of December 16, 1971, East Pakistan seceded into independent Bangladesh. At the time of East Pakistan's independence, India had detained about 97,368 West Pakistanis as prisoners of war in East Pakistan. It included 79,700 Pakistani soldiers, paramilitary personnel and another 12,500 civilians.

The Indo-Pak conflict was caused by the Bangladesh liberation struggle. The Bangladesh Liberation War was a struggle between the traditionally dominant West Pakistanis and the numerically dominant East Pakistanis. The Bangladesh Liberation War erupted after the 1970 Pakistani elections. In this election, the East Pakistan Awami League won 167 of the 169 seats in East Pakistan, with a slight majority in the 313-seat Majlis-e-Shura (Parliament of Pakistan). Awami League leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman submitted six principles to the President of Pakistan and demanded the right to form a government. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto of the Pakistan People's Party has called on President Yahya Khan to quell a West Pakistani-led military protest over his refusal to transfer power over the Pakistani government to Mujibur.

The Chinese army did not move forward as all the roads between the Himalayan mountains were covered with snow during the winter, so wait until November, after which India heavily deployed its troops along the borders. On November 23, Yahya Khan declared a state of emergency in Pakistan and called on all civilians to prepare for war. The targets are 480 km from the border. There is also Agra in the distance. During the war, the Taj Mahal was covered with leaves, twigs, and hemp, as its stone, shining like a white light in the moonlight, was easily visible to the enemy. Late at night, Indian warplanes began to attack Pakistan. Over the next few days, India launched a thirty-day offensive with its own army, navy and air force.

The death toll in East Pakistan is unknown. RJ estimates that tens of millions to thirty million will die. Rummel guessed. Other estimates put the number at 300,000. On the brink of defeat on December 14, the Pakistani army, along with local comrades, systematically killed a large number of Bengali doctors, teachers and intellectuals. It was part of a massacre of Hindu minorities belonging to the intelligentsia. Students and youths who thought they could revolt were also attacked. The largest military surrender since World War I took place during this war. Although India initially intended to prosecute 200 prisoners for war crimes, it agreed to release all prisoners in order to initiate a treaty. The following year, with the Shimla Agreement, India ceded Pakistani territory to Pakistan for the 15,000 sq km it had won in the war. India has signed the agreement as an indication that it has no intention of invading neighboring countries and to establish lasting peace with Pakistan.

The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest species in the Felidae family. It is part of the genus Panthera. Its specialty is the thick vertical stripes on the orange-brown skin. These verticals thin out as you go down. It is a predatory animal at the top of the food chain. It mainly hunts mammals (hoofed animals) such as deer and wild boar. It is limited to one place. Usually a solitary predator. It needs spacious, adequate food and habitat to support its offspring. The tiger cubs stay with their mother for two years, before becoming independent. After that, they split up, go beyond the confines of the mother's home and live independently.

The tiger was once widespread from eastern Anatolia in the west to the Amur river basin, from the Himalayan mountain ranges in the south to Bali in the Sunda Islands. Since the beginning of the 20th century, the tiger population has declined by at least 93%. The tiger has disappeared in western and central Asia, from the islands of Java and Bali, to vast areas in Southeast, South Asia and China. Today's tiger population is scattered from the temperate forests of Siberia to the subtropical and subtropical forests of the Indian subcontinent, Sumatra. The tiger has been listed as endangered by the IUCN Red List since 1986. As of 2015, the world tiger population is estimated to be between 3,062 - 3,948 . It dropped to around 100,000 at the beginning of the 20th century. Habitat destruction, habitat fragmentation, and hunting are the main causes of population decline. As it inhabits more densely populated areas on Earth, significant conflicts with humans have occurred.

In the absence of human intervention, the tiger is primarily diurnal (i.e. working during the day and resting at night). Although it does not climb large trees, there are records of climbing. It can swim nicely. Often bathes in ponds, lakes and rivers. This reduces the daytime heat. Can cross a wide river. 29 km in a single day. Can swim long distances. In the 1980s, a tiger was frequently seen hunting in the deep lake of Ranthambore National Park.
Young female tigers establish their first territories close to their mother. The female tiger's overlap between her mother's territories decreases over time. However, males go farther than females and go younger than females to establish their own kingdom. The male male tiger finds an area where there are no other male tigers and establishes a kingdom. Or another male will live unstable in the territory until he is strong enough to resist the tiger of that kingdom.
In the wild, tigers feed mostly on large, medium sized mammals. Especially eagles that weigh 60-250 kg. Range-wide, Sambar Deer, Manchurian Vapiti, Bursing, Wild boar are the most popular. Tigers are capable of hunting large animals such as gourds. But monkeys, peafowls, other land-based birds, rabbits, pigeons, and even very small prey such as fish are eaten by chance. They also prey on other predators such as dogs, leopards, pythons, bears, and crocodiles. Tigers generally do not prey on fully grown Asian elephants or Indian rhinos. But there are some instances of such hunting. Very often, they eat small calves that are easily found. They also hunt pets such as cattle, horses and donkeys when they are close to human habitations. Although tigers are carnivores, they occasionally eat fruits such as fruits for fiber.

From Hanmakonda bus stand to Medaram, the bus fare is Rs. 90 for adults and Rs. 45 for children. The fair takes place. After the Kumbh Mela, the fair was declared a state festival by the state government in 1996. Apart from the state, the Medaram region is crowded with millions of devotees from neighboring states like Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra and Odisha. Millions of devotees pay homage to the Sammakka-Saralamma plants by swaying with devotional ecstasy and poonakas. Local legends say that it dates back to the reign of Emperor Prataparudra who ruled Orugallu from 1260 to 1320 AD. The Medaram region was ruled by Padigidraja during that period. He was the feudal lord of the Kakatiyas.

The Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) was formed with the sole aim of establishing a separate Telangana Rashtra. On April 27, 2001, Kalvakuntla Chandrasekhara Rao resigned as the then Deputy Speaker of the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly, a member of the Legislative Assembly and a primary member of the Telugu Desam Party. He formed Teresa along with some leaders like Prakash. Some leaders like Ale Narendra, Satyanarayana Reddy, left Teresa. Nizam's granddaughter Salima Basha (daughter of Asmat Basha) and her daughter Rafatisha Azampura declared their support for Telangana. He said that the Muslim community in the old town was not against Telangana. Sudarshan Rao, Naini Narsinghareddy, Hanmantrao, Gade Innayya, V. Prakash, Nimma Narsimhareddy, Narayanareddy, Gotte Bhupathi, Mandadi Satyanarayanareddy, Harish Rao and others participated in the program. The TRS party has been active in the watershed for over a year. A public meeting held on May 17, 2001 at the SR College Grounds in Karimnagar laid the groundwork for major changes in joint AP politics. JMM Chief, then Jharkhand CM Shibu Soren attended the meeting as the Chief Guest. After some incidents, the activities of Telangana Rashtra Samithi shifted to KCR's residence in Nandinagar, Hyderabad. Six months later the party office was shifted to the home of Vedantarao, a former minister in the MLA colony. In 2004, the YS government allotted the site of the present Telangana Bhavan at Banjara Hills Road No. 12 to TRS. A shed of petals has been set up on the site where the canteen is currently under construction and the construction of the TRS party office has begun. Telangana Bhavan was inaugurated in 2006. The party currently has 60 lakh activists.

From giving an ideological role to the party to directing its activities, he studied and understood the Telangana society and the nature of the country's political system in depth and designed the strategy of the Telangana movement. He said that State Fight should replace Street Fight and the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) has been formed as a vehicle for that. It was a bold formulation of the then Telangana political situation. The Telangana Rashtra Samithi announced its alliance with the Congress in the 2004 elections, with the then Congress chief Sonia Gandhi announcing a separate Telangana in Karimnagar, and the inclusion of the Telangana issue in the President's speech. TRS has succeeded in including the Telangana issue in the UPA Common Minimum Program. The TRS party has worked hard to get almost 36 parties to write letters in favor of Telangana. KCR went on a death hunger strike saying that KCR will die or Telangana will come. With his initiation, the movement in Telangana gained momentum. On December 9, 2009, the UPA government announced that it would begin the process of establishing Telangana. However, the decision was reversed on December 23 after protests erupted in coastal and Rayalaseema areas. Srikrishna set up a committee to gather everyone's views on the formation of Telangana. At this stage, the TRS along with other parties formed the Telangana Political Joint Action Committee. The political JAC has intensified pressure on the Center for a separate Telangana. On December 16, 2010, 20 lakh people attended the TRS-led roar in Warangal. The TRS has undertaken a number of agitation programs since January 2011 after the submission of the Srikrishna Committee report. KCR, a movement leader who founded the party with the aim of establishing a state on the whole, came to power twice and was sworn in as the Chief Minister. The order experienced many ups and downs. Faktu became a political party after the formation of Telangana state.

A black hole is a space-time region that exhibits a very strong gravitational acceleration. No matter how strong gravity is, from its gravity, no particle, ultimately anything, including electromagnetic radiation like light, can escape from it. The general theory of relativity assumes that if any mass is dense enough, it will bend spacetime and form a black hole. The boundary of an area that cannot be reversed is called the event horizon. Although the event horizon has a tremendous effect on the motion of an object that crosses the event horizon, no locally recognizable features can be observed. In many ways, the black hole is also like an ideal black body. Like the black body, it does not reflect light. In addition, quantum field theory predicts that event horizons will emit Hawking radiation. This radiation is in the same spectrum as the radiation emitted by the black body at a temperature inversely proportional to its mass. For black holes with stellar mass black holes, this temperature is hundreds of billions of kelvins. It is impossible to observe this due to such a low temperature.

The movie starts with a scene where Valmiki (Murali Sharma) comes on a scooter on a rainy night. Valmiki, who came to see his wife and child, who had just given birth, gets jealous when he sees Ramachandra (Jayaram)'s car there. For Valmiki, though Ramachandra joins the same company as colleagues, his stage turns around when the owner of the company, Aditya Radhakrishnan alias ARK (Sachin Khedekhar) marries his daughter Yasu (Tabu) to Ramachandra. The hospital nurse, who noticed that Yasu was also giving birth in the same hospital but there was no movement in the baby before Yasu, told Valmiki about it. Pretending to be good in front of the nurse, Valmi tells him to put his baby in Jesus 'place and put Jesus' baby next to his wife. Meanwhile Jesus clings to Valmiki that this change must take place, even if there is movement in the child. The nurse falls down and loses consciousness in the scramble that ensues. Valmiki will set foot permanently.

Pretending to be good in front of the nurse, Valmi tells him to put his baby in Jesus 'place and put Jesus' baby next to his wife. Meanwhile Jesus clings to Valmiki that this change must take place, even if there is movement in the child. The nurse falls down and loses consciousness in the scramble that ensues. Valmiki will set foot permanently.

The appointments of judges to the highest posts in the Indian judiciary, the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court are carried out through a flawed system called the Collegium. Only those who know the Sama, Dana, Veda and Dandopayas who attract the attention of the collegium comprising the High Court, and the Supreme Court judges who are currently in office, will prevail. At present (2019-2024) the Modi-led central government is trying to abolish this flawed collegium policy (British approach) but has been thwarted by those in the highest positions in the Indian judiciary. Let us hope that this flawed collegium system in the Indian judiciary will be abolished and a talent base system will come.

Divorce is when a couple decides to separate after marriage for unavoidable reasons. Divorce is more common in families where both spouses are employed. Divorce has a devastating effect on children in separated families. Early divorce petitions are filed during marriage. Divorce can be granted on the grounds that the spouse has a history of illness, such as leprosy or mental illness. These are being abused by some couples. Back then marriage disputes were settled at home between four walls. Parents have to give up their ego for the sake of their children. In the case of a girl, the situation is more serious during marriage.

Although the first plan for railways in India was introduced in 1832, no progress was made until another decade later. In 1837 it ran from the Red Hills to the Chintapret Bridge. It was called the Red Hill Railway and used a rotary steam locomotive made by William Avery. The railway was built by Sir Arthur Cotton and was mainly used to transport granite stones for road construction work in Madras. In 1844, the then Governor-General, Lord Hardinge authorized private companies to establish the railway system. He set up two new railway companies and directed the East India Company to assist them. The railway system developed rapidly over the next few years due to the interest of investors in England. The Godavari Dam Construction Railway was built in 1845 at Dolslevam in Rajahmundry which was used to supply stones for the construction of a dam at Godavari. The Solani Aqueduct Railway was built in Roorkee in 1851 and is powered by steam locomotives called "Thomasson" after a British official. Used to transport construction materials for a canal on the Solani River. The total distance of the journey was 34 km, using Sahib, Sultan and Sind engines. In a way it can be said that this incident was the beginning of Indian Railways.

The vast geographical and diverse natural landscape makes it difficult to describe the Indian climate in the same way due to the different climatic conditions. Based on the Copenhagenic climate classification, the Indian climate is divided into six main sections: the arid desert in the west, the glaciers in the north, the alpine tundra, and the humid tropics that support the rainforests in the islands in the southwest. Many areas have different types of microclimates. The country's Meteorological Department follows four climate and international standards with some local changes. Winter (December, January, February), Summer (March, April, May), Monsoon (June to September), a post-monsoon: period (October to November).

Jayashankar is constructing the Kaleswaram Upliftment Project on the Godavari River at Kannepalli village in the Mahadevpur zone of Bhupalpally district. Its strategic area is 45,00,000 acres. This is the former Dr. BR Ambedkar Pranahita - Chevella Sujala Sravanti project. Its goal is to lift about 235 TMC of water. This is the largest project undertaken after the formation of the state of Telangana. The foundation stone was laid on May 2, 2016. The Kaleswaram project is not one. It is a collection of some barrages, pump houses, canals, tunnels. But, everything is interrelated. The project is designed to maximize the utilization of Godavari water. Currently the largest multi-stage lift irrigation project in the world. It is located at the confluence of the rivers Pranahita and Godavari. The project is aimed at diverting 195 TMC of water in the state of Telangana to the backward areas through the use of the waters of the Pranahita and Indravati rivers, which meet mainly at Godavari at Kaleswaram and Dammur.

In Telangana, the biggest difficulty in diverting Godavari water into canals is the elevation of the land. As the area is on the Deccan Plateau, water from the river has to be pumped into the Todi canal by motors. The Kaleshwaram scheme is designed to divert 180 TMCs from the Godavari River at a rate of two TMCs per day for ninety days, for which hundreds of km. Distance canals and tunnels are being constructed, the largest lifts in India and the largest surge pool in Asia for pumping water, for which underground pump houses and barrages are being constructed on the Godavari River respectively.
