In the 1960s , a series of discoveries , the most important of which was seafloor spreading , showed that the Earth 's lithosphere , which includes the crust and rigid uppermost portion of the upper mantle , is separated into a number of tectonic plates that move across the plastically deforming , solid , upper mantle , which is called the asthenosphere . There is an intimate coupling between the movement of the plates on the surface and the convection of the mantle : oceanic plate motions and mantle convection currents always move in the same direction , because the oceanic lithosphere is the rigid upper thermal boundary layer of the convecting mantle . This coupling between rigid plates moving on the surface of the Earth and the convecting mantle is called plate tectonics .

The development of plate tectonics provided a physical basis for many observations of the solid Earth . Long linear regions of geologic features could be explained as plate boundaries . Mid-ocean ridges , high regions on the seafloor where hydrothermal vents and volcanoes exist , were explained as divergent boundaries , where two plates move apart . Arcs of volcanoes and earthquakes were explained as convergent boundaries , where one plate subducts under another . Transform boundaries , such as the San Andreas fault system , resulted in widespread powerful earthquakes . Plate tectonics also provided a mechanism for Alfred Wegener 's theory of continental drift , in which the continents move across the surface of the Earth over geologic time . They also provided a driving force for crustal deformation , and a new setting for the observations of structural geology . The power of the theory of plate tectonics lies in its ability to combine all of these observations into a single theory of how the lithosphere moves over the convecting mantle .

Seismologists can use the arrival times of seismic waves in reverse to image the interior of the Earth . Early advances in this field showed the existence of a liquid outer core ( where shear waves were not able to propagate ) and a dense solid inner core . These advances led to the development of a layered model of the Earth , with a crust and lithosphere on top , the mantle below ( separated within itself by seismic discontinuities at 410 and 660 kilometers ) , and the outer core and inner core below that . More recently , seismologists have been able to create detailed images of wave speeds inside the earth in the same way a doctor images a body in a CT scan . These images have led to a much more detailed view of the interior of the Earth , and have replaced the simplified layered model with a much more dynamic model .

The following four timelines show the geologic time scale . The first shows the entire time from the formation of the Earth to the present , but this compresses the most recent eon . Therefore , the second scale shows the most recent eon with an expanded scale . The second scale compresses the most recent era , so the most recent era is expanded in the third scale . Since the Quaternary is a very short period with short epochs , it is further expanded in the fourth scale . The second , third , and fourth timelines are therefore each subsections of their preceding timeline as indicated by asterisks . The Holocene ( the latest epoch ) is too small to be shown clearly on the third timeline on the right , another reason for expanding the fourth scale . The Pleistocene ( P ) epoch . Q stands for the Quaternary period .

The principle of cross-cutting relationships pertains to the formation of faults and the age of the sequences through which they cut . Faults are younger than the rocks they cut ; accordingly , if a fault is found that penetrates some formations but not those on top of it , then the formations that were cut are older than the fault , and the ones that are not cut must be younger than the fault . Finding the key bed in these situations may help determine whether the fault is a normal fault or a thrust fault .

The principle of inclusions and components states that , with sedimentary rocks , if inclusions ( or clasts ) are found in a formation , then the inclusions must be older than the formation that contains them . For example , in sedimentary rocks , it is common for gravel from an older formation to be ripped up and included in a newer layer . A similar situation with igneous rocks occurs when xenoliths are found . These foreign bodies are picked up as magma or lava flows , and are incorporated , later to cool in the matrix . As a result , xenoliths are older than the rock which contains them .

The principle of faunal succession is based on the appearance of fossils in sedimentary rocks . As organisms exist at the same time period throughout the world , their presence or ( sometimes ) absence may be used to provide a relative age of the formations in which they are found . Based on principles laid out by William Smith almost a hundred years before the publication of Charles Darwin 's theory of evolution , the principles of succession were developed independently of evolutionary thought . The principle becomes quite complex , however , given the uncertainties of fossilization , the localization of fossil types due to lateral changes in habitat ( facies change in sedimentary strata ) , and that not all fossils may be found globally at the same time .

At the beginning of the 20th century , important advancement in geological science was facilitated by the ability to obtain accurate absolute dates to geologic events using radioactive isotopes and other methods . This changed the understanding of geologic time . Previously , geologists could only use fossils and stratigraphic correlation to date sections of rock relative to one another . With isotopic dates it became possible to assign absolute ages to rock units , and these absolute dates could be applied to fossil sequences in which there was datable material , converting the old relative ages into new absolute ages .

With isotopic dates it became possible to assign absolute ages to rock units , and these absolute dates could be applied to fossil sequences in which there was datable material , converting the old relative ages into new absolute ages .

For many geologic applications , isotope ratios of radioactive elements are measured in minerals that give the amount of time that has passed since a rock passed through its particular closure temperature , the point at which different radiometric isotopes stop diffusing into and out of the crystal lattice . These are used in geochronologic and thermochronologic studies . Common methods include uranium-lead dating , potassium-argon dating , argon-argon dating and uranium-thorium dating . These methods are used for a variety of applications . Dating of lava and volcanic ash layers found within a stratigraphic sequence can provide absolute age data for sedimentary rock units which do not contain radioactive isotopes and calibrate relative dating techniques . These methods can also be used to determine ages of pluton emplacement . Thermochemical techniques can be used to determine temperature profiles within the crust , the uplift of mountain ranges , and paleotopography .

When rock units are placed under horizontal compression , they shorten and become thicker . Because rock units , other than muds , do not significantly change in volume , this is accomplished in two primary ways : through faulting and folding . In the shallow crust , where brittle deformation can occur , thrust faults form , which cause deeper rock to move on top of shallower rock . Because deeper rock is often older , as noted by the principle of superposition , this can result in older rocks moving on top of younger ones . Movement along faults can result in folding , either because the faults are not planar or because rock layers are dragged along , forming drag folds as slip occurs along the fault . Deeper in the Earth , rocks behave plastically , and fold instead of faulting . These folds can either be those where the material in the center of the fold buckles upwards , creating " antiforms " , or where it buckles downwards , creating " synforms " . If the tops of the rock units within the folds remain pointing upwards , they are called anticlines and synclines , respectively . If some of the units in the fold are facing downward , the structure is called an overturned anticline or syncline , and if all of the rock units are overturned or the correct up-direction is unknown , they are simply called by the most general terms , antiforms and synforms .

Extension causes the rock units as a whole to become longer and thinner . This is primarily accomplished through normal faulting and through the ductile stretching and thinning . Normal faults drop rock units that are higher below those that are lower . This typically results in younger units being placed below older units . Stretching of units can result in their thinning ; in fact , there is a location within the Maria Fold and Thrust Belt in which the entire sedimentary sequence of the Grand Canyon can be seen over a length of less than a meter . Rocks at the depth to be ductilely stretched are often also metamorphosed . These stretched rocks can also pinch into lenses , known as boudins , after the French word for " sausage " , because of their visual similarity .

The addition of new rock units , both depositionally and intrusively , often occurs during deformation . Faulting and other deformational processes result in the creation of topographic gradients , causing material on the rock unit that is increasing in elevation to be eroded by hillslopes and channels . These sediments are deposited on the rock unit that is going down . Continual motion along the fault maintains the topographic gradient in spite of the movement of sediment , and continues to create accommodation space for the material to deposit . Deformational events are often also associated with volcanism and igneous activity . Volcanic ashes and lavas accumulate on the surface , and igneous intrusions enter from below . Dikes , long , planar igneous intrusions , enter along cracks , and therefore often form in large numbers in areas that are being actively deformed . This can result in the emplacement of dike swarms , such as those that are observable across the Canadian shield , or rings of dikes around the lava tube of a volcano .

All of these processes do not necessarily occur in a single environment , and do not necessarily occur in a single order . The Hawaiian Islands , for example , consist almost entirely of layered basaltic lava flows . The sedimentary sequences of the mid-continental United States and the Grand Canyon in the southwestern United States contain almost-undeformed stacks of sedimentary rocks that have remained in place since Cambrian time . Other areas are much more geologically complex . In the southwestern United States , sedimentary , volcanic , and intrusive rocks have been metamorphosed , faulted , foliated , and folded . Even older rocks , such as the Acasta gneiss of the Slave craton in northwestern Canada , the oldest known rock in the world have been metamorphosed to the point where their origin is undiscernable without laboratory analysis . In addition , these processes can occur in stages . In many places , the Grand Canyon in the southwestern United States being a very visible example , the lower rock units were metamorphosed and deformed , and then deformation ended and the upper , undeformed units were deposited . Although any amount of rock emplacement and rock deformation can occur , and they can occur any number of times , these concepts provide a guide to understanding the geological history of an area .

Geologists use a number of field , laboratory , and numerical modeling methods to decipher Earth history and understand the processes that occur on and inside the Earth . In typical geological investigations , geologists use primary information related to petrology ( the study of rocks ) , stratigraphy ( the study of sedimentary layers ) , and structural geology ( the study of positions of rock units and their deformation ) . In many cases , geologists also study modern soils , rivers , landscapes , and glaciers ; investigate past and current life and biogeochemical pathways , and use geophysical methods to investigate the subsurface .

In addition to identifying rocks in the field , petrologists identify rock samples in the laboratory . Two of the primary methods for identifying rocks in the laboratory are through optical microscopy and by using an electron microprobe . In an optical mineralogy analysis , thin sections of rock samples are analyzed through a petrographic microscope , where the minerals can be identified through their different properties in plane-polarized and cross-polarized light , including their birefringence , pleochroism , twinning , and interference properties with a conoscopic lens . In the electron microprobe , individual locations are analyzed for their exact chemical compositions and variation in composition within individual crystals . Stable and radioactive isotope studies provide insight into the geochemical evolution of rock units .

Petrologists can also use fluid inclusion data and perform high temperature and pressure physical experiments to understand the temperatures and pressures at which different mineral phases appear , and how they change through igneous and metamorphic processes . This research can be extrapolated to the field to understand metamorphic processes and the conditions of crystallization of igneous rocks . This work can also help to explain processes that occur within the Earth , such as subduction and magma chamber evolution .

Structural geologists use microscopic analysis of oriented thin sections of geologic samples to observe the fabric within the rocks which gives information about strain within the crystalline structure of the rocks . They also plot and combine measurements of geological structures in order to better understand the orientations of faults and folds in order to reconstruct the history of rock deformation in the area . In addition , they perform analog and numerical experiments of rock deformation in large and small settings .

Among the most well-known experiments in structural geology are those involving orogenic wedges , which are zones in which mountains are built along convergent tectonic plate boundaries . In the analog versions of these experiments , horizontal layers of sand are pulled along a lower surface into a back stop , which results in realistic-looking patterns of faulting and the growth of a critically tapered ( all angles remain the same ) orogenic wedge . Numerical models work in the same way as these analog models , though they are often more sophisticated and can include patterns of erosion and uplift in the mountain belt . This helps to show the relationship between erosion and the shape of the mountain range . These studies can also give useful information about pathways for metamorphism through pressure , temperature , space , and time .

In the laboratory , stratigraphers analyze samples of stratigraphic sections that can be returned from the field , such as those from drill cores . Stratigraphers also analyze data from geophysical surveys that show the locations of stratigraphic units in the subsurface . Geophysical data and well logs can be combined to produce a better view of the subsurface , and stratigraphers often use computer programs to do this in three dimensions . Stratigraphers can then use these data to reconstruct ancient processes occurring on the surface of the Earth , interpret past environments , and locate areas for water , coal , and hydrocarbon extraction .

In the laboratory , biostratigraphers analyze rock samples from outcrop and drill cores for the fossils found in them . These fossils help scientists to date the core and to understand the depositional environment in which the rock units formed . Geochronologists precisely date rocks within the stratigraphic section in order to provide better absolute bounds on the timing and rates of deposition . Magnetic stratigraphers look for signs of magnetic reversals in igneous rock units within the drill cores . Other scientists perform stable isotope studies on the rocks to gain information about past climate .

Some modern scholars , such as Fielding H. Garrison , are of the opinion that the origin of the science of geology can be traced to Persia after the Muslim conquests had come to an end . Abu al-Rayhan al-Biruni ( 973–1048 CE ) was one of the earliest Persian geologists , whose works included the earliest writings on the geology of India , hypothesizing that the Indian subcontinent was once a sea . Drawing from Greek and Indian scientific literature that were not destroyed by the Muslim conquests , the Persian scholar Ibn Sina ( Avicenna , 981–1037 ) proposed detailed explanations for the formation of mountains , the origin of earthquakes , and other topics central to modern geology , which provided an essential foundation for the later development of the science . In China , the polymath Shen Kuo ( 1031–1095 ) formulated a hypothesis for the process of land formation : based on his observation of fossil animal shells in a geological stratum in a mountain hundreds of miles from the ocean , he inferred that the land was formed by erosion of the mountains and by deposition of silt .

James Hutton is often viewed as the first modern geologist . In 1785 he presented a paper entitled Theory of the Earth to the Royal Society of Edinburgh . In his paper , he explained his theory that the Earth must be much older than had previously been supposed in order to allow enough time for mountains to be eroded and for sediments to form new rocks at the bottom of the sea , which in turn were raised up to become dry land . Hutton published a two-volume version of his ideas in 1795 ( Vol . 1 , Vol . 2 ) .

The first geological map of the U.S. was produced in 1809 by William Maclure . In 1807 , Maclure commenced the self-imposed task of making a geological survey of the United States . Almost every state in the Union was traversed and mapped by him , the Allegheny Mountains being crossed and recrossed some 50 times . The results of his unaided labours were submitted to the American Philosophical Society in a memoir entitled Observations on the Geology of the United States explanatory of a Geological Map , and published in the Society 's Transactions , together with the nation 's first geological map . This antedates William Smith 's geological map of England by six years , although it was constructed using a different classification of rocks .

The results of his unaided labours were submitted to the American Philosophical Society in a memoir entitled Observations on the Geology of the United States explanatory of a Geological Map , and published in the Society 's Transactions , together with the nation 's first geological map . This antedates William Smith 's geological map of England by six years , although it was constructed using a different classification of rocks .

Sir Charles Lyell first published his famous book , Principles of Geology , in 1830 . This book , which influenced the thought of Charles Darwin , successfully promoted the doctrine of uniformitarianism . This theory states that slow geological processes have occurred throughout the Earth 's history and are still occurring today . In contrast , catastrophism is the theory that Earth 's features formed in single , catastrophic events and remained unchanged thereafter . Though Hutton believed in uniformitarianism , the idea was not widely accepted at the time .

The word pharmacy is derived from its root word pharma which was a term used since the 15th–17th centuries . However , the original Greek roots from pharmakos imply sorcery or even poison . In addition to pharma responsibilities , the pharma offered general medical advice and a range of services that are now performed solely by other specialist practitioners , such as surgery and midwifery . The pharma ( as it was referred to ) often operated through a retail shop which , in addition to ingredients for medicines , sold tobacco and patent medicines . Often the place that did this was called an apothecary and several languages have this as the dominant term , though their practices are more akin to a modern pharmacy , in English the term apothecary would today be seen as outdated or only approproriate if herbal remedies were on offer to a large extent . The pharmas also used many other herbs not listed . The Greek word Pharmakeia ( Greek ) derives from pharmakon , meaning " drug " , " medicine " ( or " poison " ) . [ n 1 ]
Pharmacists are healthcare professionals with specialised education and training who perform various roles to ensure optimal health outcomes for their patients through the quality use of medicines . Pharmacists may also be small-business proprietors , owning the pharmacy in which they practice . Since pharmacists know about the mode of action of a particular drug , and its metabolism and physiological effects on the human body in great detail , they play an important role in optimisation of a drug treatment for an individual .

In Ancient Greece , Diocles of Carystus ( 4th century BC ) was one of several men studying the medicinal properties of plants . He wrote several treatises on the topic . The Greek physician Pedanius Dioscorides is famous for writing a five volume book in his native Greek Περί ύλης ιατρικής in the 1st century AD . The Latin translation De Materia Medica ( Concerning medical substances ) was used a basis for many medieval texts , and was built upon by many middle eastern scientists during the Islamic Golden Age . The title coined the term materia medica .

In Japan , at the end of the Asuka period ( 538–710 ) and the early Nara period ( 710–794 ) , the men who fulfilled roles similar to those of modern pharmacists were highly respected . The place of pharmacists in society was expressly defined in the Taihō Code ( 701 ) and re-stated in the Yōrō Code ( 718 ) . Ranked positions in the pre-Heian Imperial court were established ; and this organizational structure remained largely intact until the Meiji Restoration ( 1868 ) . In this highly stable hierarchy , the pharmacists—and even pharmacist assistants—were assigned status superior to all others in health-related fields such as physicians and acupuncturists . In the Imperial household , the pharmacist was even ranked above the two personal physicians of the Emperor .

The advances made in the Middle East in botany and chemistry led medicine in medieval Islam substantially to develop pharmacology . Muhammad ibn Zakarīya Rāzi ( Rhazes ) ( 865–915 ) , for instance , acted to promote the medical uses of chemical compounds . Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi ( Abulcasis ) ( 936–1013 ) pioneered the preparation of medicines by sublimation and distillation . His Liber servitoris is of particular interest , as it provides the reader with recipes and explains how to prepare the `simples ’ from which were compounded the complex drugs then generally used . Sabur Ibn Sahl ( d 869 ) , was , however , the first physician to initiate pharmacopoedia , describing a large variety of drugs and remedies for ailments . Al-Biruni ( 973–1050 ) wrote one of the most valuable Islamic works on pharmacology , entitled Kitab al-Saydalah ( The Book of Drugs ) , in which he detailed the properties of drugs and outlined the role of pharmacy and the functions and duties of the pharmacist . Avicenna , too , described no less than 700 preparations , their properties , modes of action , and their indications . He devoted in fact a whole volume to simple drugs in The Canon of Medicine . Of great impact were also the works by al-Maridini of Baghdad and Cairo , and Ibn al-Wafid ( 1008–1074 ) , both of which were printed in Latin more than fifty times , appearing as De Medicinis universalibus et particularibus by 'Mesue ' the younger , and the Medicamentis simplicibus by 'Abenguefit ' . Peter of Abano ( 1250–1316 ) translated and added a supplement to the work of al-Maridini under the title De Veneris . Al-Muwaffaq ’ s contributions in the field are also pioneering . Living in the 10th century , he wrote The foundations of the true properties of Remedies , amongst others describing arsenious oxide , and being acquainted with silicic acid . He made clear distinction between sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate , and drew attention to the poisonous nature of copper compounds , especially copper vitriol , and also lead compounds . He also describes the distillation of sea-water for drinking . [ verification needed ]

In most countries , the dispensary is subject to pharmacy legislation ; with requirements for storage conditions , compulsory texts , equipment , etc. , specified in legislation . Where it was once the case that pharmacists stayed within the dispensary compounding/dispensing medications , there has been an increasing trend towards the use of trained pharmacy technicians while the pharmacist spends more time communicating with patients . Pharmacy technicians are now more dependent upon automation to assist them in their new role dealing with patients ' prescriptions and patient safety issues .

In the U.S. federal health care system ( including the VA , the Indian Health Service , and NIH ) ambulatory care pharmacists are given full independent prescribing authority . In some states such North Carolina and New Mexico these pharmacist clinicians are given collaborative prescriptive and diagnostic authority . In 2011 the board of Pharmaceutical Specialties approved ambulatory care pharmacy practice as a separate board certification . The official designation for pharmacists who pass the ambulatory care pharmacy specialty certification exam will be Board Certified Ambulatory Care Pharmacist and these pharmacists will carry the initials BCACP .

Since about the year 2000 , a growing number of Internet pharmacies have been established worldwide . Many of these pharmacies are similar to community pharmacies , and in fact , many of them are actually operated by brick-and-mortar community pharmacies that serve consumers online and those that walk in their door . The primary difference is the method by which the medications are requested and received . Some customers consider this to be more convenient and private method rather than traveling to a community drugstore where another customer might overhear about the drugs that they take . Internet pharmacies ( also known as online pharmacies ) are also recommended to some patients by their physicians if they are homebound .

In the United States , there has been a push to legalize importation of medications from Canada and other countries , in order to reduce consumer costs . While in most cases importation of prescription medications violates Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) regulations and federal laws , enforcement is generally targeted at international drug suppliers , rather than consumers . There is no known case of any U.S. citizens buying Canadian drugs for personal use with a prescription , who has ever been charged by authorities .

Pharmacy informatics is the combination of pharmacy practice science and applied information science . Pharmacy informaticists work in many practice areas of pharmacy , however , they may also work in information technology departments or for healthcare information technology vendor companies . As a practice area and specialist domain , pharmacy informatics is growing quickly to meet the needs of major national and international patient information projects and health system interoperability goals . Pharmacists in this area are trained to participate in medication management system development , deployment and optimization .
Specialty pharmacies supply high cost injectable , oral , infused , or inhaled medications that are used for chronic and complex disease states such as cancer , hepatitis , and rheumatoid arthritis . Unlike a traditional community pharmacy where prescriptions for any common medication can be brought in and filled , specialty pharmacies carry novel medications that need to be properly stored , administered , carefully monitored , and clinically managed . In addition to supplying these drugs , specialty pharmacies also provide lab monitoring , adherence counseling , and assist patients with cost-containment strategies needed to obtain their expensive specialty drugs . It is currently the fastest growing sector of the pharmaceutical industry with 19 of 28 newly FDA approved medications in 2013 being specialty drugs .

In most jurisdictions ( such as the United States ) , pharmacists are regulated separately from physicians . These jurisdictions also usually specify that only pharmacists may supply scheduled pharmaceuticals to the public , and that pharmacists can not form business partnerships with physicians or give them " kickback " payments . However , the American Medical Association ( AMA ) Code of Ethics provides that physicians may dispense drugs within their office practices as long as there is no patient exploitation and patients have the right to a written prescription that can be filled elsewhere . 7 to 10 percent of American physicians practices reportedly dispense drugs on their own .

In some rural areas in the United Kingdom , there are dispensing physicians who are allowed to both prescribe and dispense prescription-only medicines to their patients from within their practices . The law requires that the GP practice be located in a designated rural area and that there is also a specified , minimum distance ( currently 1.6 kilometres ) between a patient 's home and the nearest retail pharmacy . This law also exists in Austria for general physicians if the nearest pharmacy is more than 4 kilometers away , or where none is registered in the city .

This shift has already commenced in some countries ; for instance , pharmacists in Australia receive remuneration from the Australian Government for conducting comprehensive Home Medicines Reviews . In Canada , pharmacists in certain provinces have limited prescribing rights ( as in Alberta and British Columbia ) or are remunerated by their provincial government for expanded services such as medications reviews ( Medschecks in Ontario ) . In the United Kingdom , pharmacists who undertake additional training are obtaining prescribing rights and this is because of pharmacy education . They are also being paid for by the government for medicine use reviews . In Scotland the pharmacist can write prescriptions for Scottish registered patients of their regular medications , for the majority of drugs , except for controlled drugs , when the patient is unable to see their doctor , as could happen if they are away from home or the doctor is unavailable . In the United States , pharmaceutical care or clinical pharmacy has had an evolving influence on the practice of pharmacy . Moreover , the Doctor of Pharmacy ( Pharm . D. ) degree is now required before entering practice and some pharmacists now complete one or two years of residency or fellowship training following graduation . In addition , consultant pharmacists , who traditionally operated primarily in nursing homes are now expanding into direct consultation with patients , under the banner of " senior care pharmacy . "

The two symbols most commonly associated with pharmacy in English-speaking countries are the mortar and pestle and the ℞ ( recipere ) character , which is often written as " Rx " in typed text . The show globe was also used until the early 20th century . Pharmacy organizations often use other symbols , such as the Bowl of Hygieia which is often used in the Netherlands , conical measures , and caduceuses in their logos . Other symbols are common in different countries : the green Greek cross in France , Argentina , the United Kingdom , Belgium , Ireland , Italy , Spain , and India , the increasingly rare Gaper in the Netherlands , and a red stylized letter A in Germany and Austria ( from Apotheke , the German word for pharmacy , from the same Greek root as the English word 'apothecary ' ) .

One of its earliest massive implementations was brought about by Egyptians against the British occupation in the 1919 Revolution . Civil disobedience is one of the many ways people have rebelled against what they deem to be unfair laws . It has been used in many nonviolent resistance movements in India ( Gandhi 's campaigns for independence from the British Empire ) , in Czechoslovakia 's Velvet Revolution and in East Germany to oust their communist governments , In South Africa in the fight against apartheid , in the American Civil Rights Movement , in the Singing Revolution to bring independence to the Baltic countries from the Soviet Union , recently with the 2003 Rose Revolution in Georgia and the 2004 Orange Revolution in Ukraine , among other various movements worldwide .

One of the oldest depictions of civil disobedience is in Sophocles ' play Antigone , in which Antigone , one of the daughters of former King of Thebes , Oedipus , defies Creon , the current King of Thebes , who is trying to stop her from giving her brother Polynices a proper burial . She gives a stirring speech in which she tells him that she must obey her conscience rather than human law . She is not at all afraid of the death he threatens her with ( and eventually carries out ) , but she is afraid of how her conscience will smite her if she does not do this .

Following the Peterloo massacre of 1819 , poet Percy Shelley wrote the political poem The Mask of Anarchy later that year , that begins with the images of what he thought to be the unjust forms of authority of his time—and then imagines the stirrings of a new form of social action . It is perhaps the first modern [ vague ] statement of the principle of nonviolent protest . A version was taken up by the author Henry David Thoreau in his essay Civil Disobedience , and later by Gandhi in his doctrine of Satyagraha . Gandhi 's Satyagraha was partially influenced and inspired by Shelley 's nonviolence in protest and political action . In particular , it is known that Gandhi would often quote Shelley 's Masque of Anarchy to vast audiences during the campaign for a free India .

It has been argued that the term " civil disobedience " has always suffered from ambiguity and in modern times , become utterly debased . Marshall Cohen notes , " It has been used to describe everything from bringing a test-case in the federal courts to taking aim at a federal official . Indeed , for Vice President Agnew it has become a code-word describing the activities of muggers , arsonists , draft evaders , campaign hecklers , campus militants , anti-war demonstrators , juvenile delinquents and political assassins .

LeGrande writes that " the formulation of a single all-encompassing definition of the term is extremely difficult , if not impossible . In reviewing the voluminous literature on the subject , the student of civil disobedience rapidly finds himself surrounded by a maze of semantical problems and grammatical niceties . Like Alice in Wonderland , he often finds that specific terminology has no more ( or no less ) meaning than the individual orator intends it to have . " He encourages a distinction between lawful protest demonstration , nonviolent civil disobedience , and violent civil disobedience .

Civil disobedience is usually defined as pertaining to a citizen 's relation to the state and its laws , as distinguished from a constitutional impasse in which two public agencies , especially two equally sovereign branches of government , conflict . For instance , if the head of government of a country were to refuse to enforce a decision of that country 's highest court , it would not be civil disobedience , since the head of government would be acting in her or his capacity as public official rather than private citizen .

However , this definition is disputed by Thoreau 's political philosophy pitching the conscience vs. the collective . The individual is the final judge of right and wrong . More than this , since only individuals act , only individuals can act unjustly . When the government knocks on the door , it is an individual in the form of a postman or tax collector whose hand hits the wood . Before Thoreau ’ s imprisonment , when a confused taxman had wondered aloud about how to handle his refusal to pay , Thoreau had advised , “ Resign. ” If a man chose to be an agent of injustice , then Thoreau insisted on confronting him with the fact that he was making a choice . But if government is “ the voice of the people , ” as it is often called , shouldn ’ t that voice be heeded ? Thoreau admits that government may express the will of the majority but it may also express nothing more than the will of elite politicians . Even a good form of government is “ liable to be abused and perverted before the people can act through it. ” Moreover , even if a government did express the voice of the people , this fact would not compel the obedience of individuals who disagree with what is being said . The majority may be powerful but it is not necessarily right . What , then , is the proper relationship between the individual and the government ?
Some theories of civil disobedience hold that civil disobedience is only justified against governmental entities . Brownlee argues that disobedience in opposition to the decisions of non-governmental agencies such as trade unions , banks , and private universities can be justified if it reflects " a larger challenge to the legal system that permits those decisions to be taken " . The same principle , she argues , applies to breaches of law in protest against international organizations and foreign governments .

It is usually recognized that lawbreaking , if it is not done publicly , at least must be publicly announced in order to constitute civil disobedience . But Stephen Eilmann argues that if it is necessary to disobey rules that conflict with morality , we might ask why disobedience should take the form of public civil disobedience rather than simply covert lawbreaking . If a lawyer wishes to help a client overcome legal obstacles to securing her or his natural rights , he might , for instance , find that assisting in fabricating evidence or committing perjury is more effective than open disobedience . This assumes that common morality does not have a prohibition on deceit in such situations . The Fully Informed Jury Association 's publication " A Primer for Prospective Jurors " notes , " Think of the dilemma faced by German citizens when Hitler 's secret police demanded to know if they were hiding a Jew in their house . " By this definition , civil disobedience could be traced back to the Book of Exodus , where Shiphrah and Puah refused a direct order of Pharaoh but misrepresented how they did it . ( Exodus 1 : 15-19 )

There have been debates as to whether civil disobedience must necessarily be non-violent . Black 's Law Dictionary includes non-violence in its definition of civil disobedience . Christian Bay 's encyclopedia article states that civil disobedience requires " carefully chosen and legitimate means , " but holds that they do not have to be non-violent . It has been argued that , while both civil disobedience and civil rebellion are justified by appeal to constitutional defects , rebellion is much more destructive ; therefore , the defects justifying rebellion must be much more serious than those justifying disobedience , and if one can not justify civil rebellion , then one can not justify a civil disobedients ' use of force and violence and refusal to submit to arrest . Civil disobedients ' refraining from violence is also said to help preserve society 's tolerance of civil disobedience .
Non-revolutionary civil disobedience is a simple disobedience of laws on the grounds that they are judged " wrong " by an individual conscience , or as part of an effort to render certain laws ineffective , to cause their repeal , or to exert pressure to get one 's political wishes on some other issue . Revolutionary civil disobedience is more of an active attempt to overthrow a government ( or to change cultural traditions , social customs , religious beliefs , etc ... revolution does n't have to be political , i.e . " cultural revolution " , it simply implies sweeping and widespread change to a section of the social fabric ) . Gandhi 's acts have been described as revolutionary civil disobedience . It has been claimed that the Hungarians under Ferenc Deák directed revolutionary civil disobedience against the Austrian government .

Civil disobedients have chosen a variety of different illegal acts . Bedau writes , " There is a whole class of acts , undertaken in the name of civil disobedience , which , even if they were widely practiced , would in themselves constitute hardly more than a nuisance ( e.g . trespassing at a nuclear-missile installation ) ... Such acts are often just a harassment and , at least to the bystander , somewhat inane ... The remoteness of the connection between the disobedient act and the objectionable law lays such acts open to the charge of ineffectiveness and absurdity . " Bedau also notes , though , that the very harmlessness of such entirely symbolic illegal protests toward public policy goals may serve a propaganda purpose . Some civil disobedients , such as the proprietors of illegal medical cannabis dispensaries and Voice in the Wilderness , which brought medicine to Iraq without the permission of the U.S. Government , directly achieve a desired social goal ( such as the provision of medication to the sick ) while openly breaking the law . Julia Butterfly Hill lived in Luna , a 180-foot ( 55 m ) -tall , 600-year-old California Redwood tree for 738 days , successfully preventing it from being cut down .

In cases where the criminalized behavior is pure speech , civil disobedience can consist simply of engaging in the forbidden speech . An example would be WBAI 's broadcasting the track " Filthy Words " from a George Carlin comedy album , which eventually led to the 1978 Supreme Court case of FCC v. Pacifica Foundation . Threatening government officials is another classic way of expressing defiance toward the government and unwillingness to stand for its policies . For example , Joseph Haas was arrested for allegedly sending an email to the Lebanon , New Hampshire city councilors stating , " Wise up or die . "

Some forms of civil disobedience , such as illegal boycotts , refusals to pay taxes , draft dodging , distributed denial-of-service attacks , and sit-ins , make it more difficult for a system to function . In this way , they might be considered coercive . Brownlee notes that " although civil disobedients are constrained in their use of coercion by their conscientious aim to engage in moral dialogue , nevertheless they may find it necessary to employ limited coercion in order to get their issue onto the table . " The Plowshares organization temporarily closed GCSB Waihopai by padlocking the gates and using sickles to deflate one of the large domes covering two satellite dishes .

Many of the same decisions and principles that apply in other criminal investigations and arrests arise also in civil disobedience cases . For example , the suspect may need to decide whether or not to grant a consent search of his property , and whether or not to talk to police officers . It is generally agreed within the legal community , and is often believed within the activist community , that a suspect 's talking to criminal investigators can serve no useful purpose , and may be harmful . However , some civil disobedients have nonetheless found it hard to resist responding to investigators ' questions , sometimes due to a lack of understanding of the legal ramifications , or due to a fear of seeming rude . Also , some civil disobedients seek to use the arrest as an opportunity to make an impression on the officers . Thoreau wrote , " My civil neighbor , the tax-gatherer , is the very man I have to deal with -- for it is , after all , with men and not with parchment that I quarrel -- and he has voluntarily chosen to be an agent of the government . How shall he ever know well that he is and does as an officer of the government , or as a man , until he is obliged to consider whether he will treat me , his neighbor , for whom he has respect , as a neighbor and well-disposed man , or as a maniac and disturber of the peace , and see if he can get over this obstruction to his neighborliness without a ruder and more impetuous thought or speech corresponding with his action . "

Some civil disobedients feel it is incumbent upon them to accept punishment because of their belief in the validity of the social contract , which is held to bind all to obey the laws that a government meeting certain standards of legitimacy has established , or else suffer the penalties set out in the law . Other civil disobedients who favor the existence of government still do n't believe in the legitimacy of their particular government , or do n't believe in the legitimacy of a particular law it has enacted . And still other civil disobedients , being anarchists , do n't believe in the legitimacy of any government , and therefore see no need to accept punishment for a violation of criminal law that does not infringe the rights of others .

An important decision for civil disobedients is whether or not to plead guilty . There is much debate on this point , as some believe that it is a civil disobedient 's duty to submit to the punishment prescribed by law , while others believe that defending oneself in court will increase the possibility of changing the unjust law . It has also been argued that either choice is compatible with the spirit of civil disobedience . ACT-UP 's Civil Disobedience Training handbook states that a civil disobedient who pleads guilty is essentially stating , " Yes , I committed the act of which you accuse me . I do n't deny it ; in fact , I am proud of it . I feel I did the right thing by violating this particular law ; I am guilty as charged , " but that pleading not guilty sends a message of , " Guilt implies wrong-doing . I feel I have done no wrong . I may have violated some specific laws , but I am guilty of doing no wrong . I therefore plead not guilty . " A plea of no contest is sometimes regarded as a compromise between the two . One defendant accused of illegally protesting nuclear power , when asked to enter his plea , stated , " I plead for the beauty that surrounds us " ; this is known as a " creative plea , " and will usually be interpreted as a plea of not guilty .
When the Committee for Non-Violent Action sponsored a protest in August 1957 , at the Camp Mercury nuclear test site near Las Vegas , Nevada , 13 of the protesters attempted to enter the test site knowing that they faced arrest . At a pre-arranged announced time , one at a time they stepped across the " line " and were immediately arrested . They were put on a bus and taken to the Nye County seat of Tonopah , Nevada , and arraigned for trial before the local Justice of the Peace , that afternoon . A well known civil rights attorney , Francis Heisler , had volunteered to defend the arrested persons , advising them to plead " nolo contendere " , as an alternative to pleading either guilty or not-guilty . The arrested persons were found " guilty , " nevertheless , and given suspended sentences , conditional on their not reentering the test site grounds . [ citation needed ]

Howard Zinn writes , " There may be many times when protesters choose to go to jail , as a way of continuing their protest , as a way of reminding their countrymen of injustice . But that is different than the notion that they must go to jail as part of a rule connected with civil disobedience . The key point is that the spirit of protest should be maintained all the way , whether it is done by remaining in jail , or by evading it . To accept jail penitently as an accession to 'the rules ' is to switch suddenly to a spirit of subservience , to demean the seriousness of the protest ... In particular , the neo-conservative insistence on a guilty plea should be eliminated . "

But that is different than the notion that they must go to jail as part of a rule connected with civil disobedience . The key point is that the spirit of protest should be maintained all the way , whether it is done by remaining in jail , or by evading it . To accept jail penitently as an accession to 'the rules ' is to switch suddenly to a spirit of subservience , to demean the seriousness of the protest ... In particular , the neo-conservative insistence on a guilty plea should be eliminated . "
Sometimes the prosecution proposes a plea bargain to civil disobedients , as in the case of the Camden 28 , in which the defendants were offered an opportunity to plead guilty to one misdemeanor count and receive no jail time . In some mass arrest situations , the activists decide to use solidarity tactics to secure the same plea bargain for everyone . But some activists have opted to enter a blind plea , pleading guilty without any plea agreement in place . Mohandas Gandhi pleaded guilty and told the court , " I am here to . . . submit cheerfully to the highest penalty that can be inflicted upon me for what in law is a deliberate crime and what appears to me to be the highest duty of a citizen .

Some civil disobedience defendants choose to make a defiant speech , or a speech explaining their actions , in allocution . In U.S. v. Burgos-Andujar , a defendant who was involved in a movement to stop military exercises by trespassing on U.S. Navy property argued to the court in allocution that " the ones who are violating the greater law are the members of the Navy " . As a result , the judge increased her sentence from 40 to 60 days . This action was upheld because , according to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit , her statement suggested a lack of remorse , an attempt to avoid responsibility for her actions , and even a likelihood of repeating her illegal actions . Some of the other allocution speeches given by the protesters complained about mistreatment from government officials .

Steven Barkan writes that if defendants plead not guilty , " they must decide whether their primary goal will be to win an acquittal and avoid imprisonment or a fine , or to use the proceedings as a forum to inform the jury and the public of the political circumstances surrounding the case and their reasons for breaking the law via civil disobedience . " A technical defense may enhance the chances for acquittal but make for more boring proceedings and reduced press coverage . During the Vietnam War era , the Chicago Eight used a political defense , while Benjamin Spock used a technical defense . In countries such as the United States whose laws guarantee the right to a jury trial but do not excuse lawbreaking for political purposes , some civil disobedients seek jury nullification . Over the years , this has been made more difficult by court decisions such as Sparf v. United States , which held that the judge need not inform jurors of their nullification prerogative , and United States v. Dougherty , which held that the judge need not allow defendants to openly seek jury nullification .

One theory is that , while disobedience may be helpful , any great amount of it would undermine the law by encouraging general disobedience which is neither conscientious nor of social benefit . Therefore , conscientious lawbreakers must be punished . Michael Bayles argues that if a person violates a law in order to create a test case as to the constitutionality of a law , and then wins his case , then that act did not constitute civil disobedience . It has also been argued that breaking the law for self-gratification , as in the case of a homosexual or cannabis user who does not direct his act at securing the repeal of amendment of the law , is not civil disobedience . Likewise , a protestor who attempts to escape punishment by committing the crime covertly and avoiding attribution , or by denying having committed the crime , or by fleeing the jurisdiction , is generally viewed as not being a civil disobedient .

Courts have distinguished between two types of civil disobedience : " Indirect civil disobedience involves violating a law which is not , itself , the object of protest , whereas direct civil disobedience involves protesting the existence of a particular law by breaking that law . " During the Vietnam War , courts typically refused to excuse the perpetrators of illegal protests from punishment on the basis of their challenging the legality of the Vietnam War ; the courts ruled it was a political question . The necessity defense has sometimes been used as a shadow defense by civil disobedients to deny guilt without denouncing their politically motivated acts , and to present their political beliefs in the courtroom . However , court cases such as U.S. v. Schoon have greatly curtailed the availability of the political necessity defense . Likewise , when Carter Wentworth was charged for his role in the Clamshell Alliance 's 1977 illegal occupation of the Seabrook Station Nuclear Power Plant , the judge instructed the jury to disregard his competing harms defense , and he was found guilty . Fully Informed Jury Association activists have sometimes handed out educational leaflets inside courthouses despite admonitions not to ; according to FIJA , many of them have escaped prosecution because " prosecutors have reasoned ( correctly ) that if they arrest fully informed jury leafleters , the leaflets will have to be given to the leafleter 's own jury as evidence .

Along with giving the offender his " just deserts " , achieving crime control via incapacitation and deterrence is a major goal of criminal punishment . Brownlee argues , " Bringing in deterrence at the level of justification detracts from the law ’ s engagement in a moral dialogue with the offender as a rational person because it focuses attention on the threat of punishment and not the moral reasons to follow this law . " Leonard Hubert Hoffmann writes , " In deciding whether or not to impose punishment , the most important consideration would be whether it would do more harm than good . This means that the objector has no right not to be punished . It is a matter for the state ( including the judges ) to decide on utilitarian grounds whether to do so or not . "

Construction is the process of constructing a building or infrastructure . Construction differs from manufacturing in that manufacturing typically involves mass production of similar items without a designated purchaser , while construction typically takes place on location for a known client . Construction as an industry comprises six to nine percent of the gross domestic product of developed countries . Construction starts with planning , [ citation needed ] design , and financing and continues until the project is built and ready for use .

Large-scale construction requires collaboration across multiple disciplines . An architect normally manages the job , and a construction manager , design engineer , construction engineer or project manager supervises it . For the successful execution of a project , effective planning is essential . Those involved with the design and execution of the infrastructure in question must consider zoning requirements , the environmental impact of the job , the successful scheduling , budgeting , construction-site safety , availability and transportation of building materials , logistics , inconvenience to the public caused by construction delays and bidding , etc . The largest construction projects are referred to as megaprojects .

In general , there are three sectors of construction : buildings , infrastructure and industrial . Building construction is usually further divided into residential and non-residential ( commercial/institutional ) . Infrastructure is often called heavy/highway , heavy civil or heavy engineering . It includes large public works , dams , bridges , highways , water/wastewater and utility distribution . Industrial includes refineries , process chemical , power generation , mills and manufacturing plants . There are other ways to break the industry into sectors or markets .

Engineering News-Record ( ENR ) is a trade magazine for the construction industry . Each year , ENR compiles and reports on data about the size of design and construction companies . They publish a list of the largest companies in the United States ( Top-40 ) and also a list the largest global firms ( Top-250 , by amount of work they are doing outside their home country ) . In 2014 , ENR compiled the data in nine market segments . It was divided as transportation , petroleum , buildings , power , industrial , water , manufacturing , sewer/waste , telecom , hazardous waste plus a tenth category for other projects . In their reporting on the Top 400 , they used data on transportation , sewer , hazardous waste and water to rank firms as heavy contractors .

The Standard Industrial Classification and the newer North American Industry Classification System have a classification system for companies that perform or otherwise engage in construction . To recognize the differences of companies in this sector , it is divided into three subsectors : building construction , heavy and civil engineering construction , and specialty trade contractors . There are also categories for construction service firms ( e.g. , engineering , architecture ) and construction managers ( firms engaged in managing construction projects without assuming direct financial responsibility for completion of the construction project ) .
Building construction is the process of adding structure to real property or construction of buildings . The majority of building construction jobs are small renovations , such as addition of a room , or renovation of a bathroom . Often , the owner of the property acts as laborer , paymaster , and design team for the entire project . Although building construction projects typically include various common elements , such as design , financial , estimating and legal considerations , many projects of varying sizes reach undesirable end results , such as structural collapse , cost overruns , and/or litigation .

The majority of building construction jobs are small renovations , such as addition of a room , or renovation of a bathroom . Often , the owner of the property acts as laborer , paymaster , and design team for the entire project . Although building construction projects typically include various common elements , such as design , financial , estimating and legal considerations , many projects of varying sizes reach undesirable end results , such as structural collapse , cost overruns , and/or litigation . For this reason , those with experience in the field make detailed plans and maintain careful oversight during the project to ensure a positive outcome .

Residential construction practices , technologies , and resources must conform to local building authority regulations and codes of practice . Materials readily available in the area generally dictate the construction materials used ( e.g . brick versus stone , versus timber ) . Cost of construction on a per square meter ( or per square foot ) basis for houses can vary dramatically based on site conditions , local regulations , economies of scale ( custom designed homes are often more expensive to build ) and the availability of skilled tradespeople . As residential construction ( as well as all other types of construction ) can generate a lot of waste , careful planning again is needed here .

New techniques of building construction are being researched , made possible by advances in 3D printing technology . In a form of additive building construction , similar to the additive manufacturing techniques for manufactured parts , building printing is making it possible to flexibly construct small commercial buildings and private habitations in around 20 hours , with built-in plumbing and electrical facilities , in one continuous build , using large 3D printers . Working versions of 3D-printing building technology are already printing 2 metres ( 6 ft 7 in ) of building material per hour as of January 2013 [ update ] , with the next-generation printers capable of 3.5 metres ( 11 ft ) per hour , sufficient to complete a building in a week . Dutch architect Janjaap Ruijssenaars 's performative architecture 3D-printed building is scheduled to be built in 2014 .
In the modern industrialized world , construction usually involves the translation of designs into reality . A formal design team may be assembled to plan the physical proceedings , and to integrate those proceedings with the other parts . The design usually consists of drawings and specifications , usually prepared by a design team including Architect , civil engineers , mechanical engineers , electrical engineers , structural engineers , fire protection engineers , planning consultants , architectural consultants , and archaeological consultants . The design team is most commonly employed by ( i.e . in contract with ) the property owner . Under this system , once the design is completed by the design team , a number of construction companies or construction management companies may then be asked to make a bid for the work , either based directly on the design , or on the basis of drawings and a bill of quantities provided by a quantity surveyor . Following evaluation of bids , the owner typically awards a contract to the most cost efficient bidder .

Several project structures can assist the owner in this integration , including design-build , partnering and construction management . In general , each of these project structures allows the owner to integrate the services of architects , interior designers , engineers and constructors throughout design and construction . In response , many companies are growing beyond traditional offerings of design or construction services alone and are placing more emphasis on establishing relationships with other necessary participants through the design-build process .
Construction projects can suffer from preventable financial problems . Underbids happen when builders ask for too little money to complete the project . Cash flow problems exist when the present amount of funding can not cover the current costs for labour and materials , and because they are a matter of having sufficient funds at a specific time , can arise even when the overall total is enough . Fraud is a problem in many fields , but is notoriously prevalent in the construction field . Financial planning for the project is intended to ensure that a solid plan with adequate safeguards and contingency plans are in place before the project is started and is required to ensure that the plan is properly executed over the life of the project .

Mortgage bankers , accountants , and cost engineers are likely participants in creating an overall plan for the financial management of the building construction project . The presence of the mortgage banker is highly likely , even in relatively small projects since the owner 's equity in the property is the most obvious source of funding for a building project . Accountants act to study the expected monetary flow over the life of the project and to monitor the payouts throughout the process . Cost engineers and estimators apply expertise to relate the work and materials involved to a proper valuation . Cost overruns with government projects have occurred when the contractor identified change orders or project changes that increased costs , which are not subject to competition from other firms as they have already been eliminated from consideration after the initial bid .

The project must adhere to zoning and building code requirements . Constructing a project that fails to adhere to codes does not benefit the owner . Some legal requirements come from malum in se considerations , or the desire to prevent things that are indisputably bad – bridge collapses or explosions . Other legal requirements come from malum prohibitum considerations , or things that are a matter of custom or expectation , such as isolating businesses to a business district and residences to a residential district . An attorney may seek changes or exemptions in the law that governs the land where the building will be built , either by arguing that a rule is inapplicable ( the bridge design will not cause a collapse ) , or that the custom is no longer needed ( acceptance of live-work spaces has grown in the community ) .
A construction project is a complex net of contracts and other legal obligations , each of which all parties must carefully consider . A contract is the exchange of a set of obligations between two or more parties , but it is not so simple a matter as trying to get the other side to agree to as much as possible in exchange for as little as possible . The time element in construction means that a delay costs money , and in cases of bottlenecks , the delay can be extremely expensive . Thus , the contracts must be designed to ensure that each side is capable of performing the obligations set out . Contracts that set out clear expectations and clear paths to accomplishing those expectations are far more likely to result in the project flowing smoothly , whereas poorly drafted contracts lead to confusion and collapse .

There is also a growing number of new forms of procurement that involve relationship contracting where the emphasis is on a co-operative relationship between the principal and contractor and other stakeholders within a construction project . New forms include partnering such as Public-Private Partnering ( PPPs ) aka private finance initiatives ( PFIs ) and alliances such as " pure " or " project " alliances and " impure " or " strategic " alliances . The focus on co-operation is to ameliorate the many problems that arise from the often highly competitive and adversarial practices within the construction industry .

This is the most common method of construction procurement and is well established and recognized . In this arrangement , the architect or engineer acts as the project coordinator . His or her role is to design the works , prepare the specifications and produce construction drawings , administer the contract , tender the works , and manage the works from inception to completion . There are direct contractual links between the architect 's client and the main contractor . Any subcontractor has a direct contractual relationship with the main contractor . The procedure continues until the building is ready to occupy .

The owner produces a list of requirements for a project , giving an overall view of the project 's goals . Several D & B contractors present different ideas about how to accomplish these goals . The owner selects the ideas he or she likes best and hires the appropriate contractor . Often , it is not just one contractor , but a consortium of several contractors working together . Once these have been hired , they begin building the first phase of the project . As they build phase 1 , they design phase 2 . This is in contrast to a design-bid-build contract , where the project is completely designed by the owner , then bid on , then completed .
Before the foundation can be dug , contractors are typically required to verify and have existing utility lines marked , either by the utilities themselves or through a company specializing in such services . This lessens the likelihood of damage to the existing electrical , water , sewage , phone , and cable facilities , which could cause outages and potentially hazardous situations . During the construction of a building , the municipal building inspector inspects the building periodically to ensure that the construction adheres to the approved plans and the local building code . Once construction is complete and a final inspection has been passed , an occupancy permit may be issued .

In 2010 a salary survey revealed the differences in remuneration between different roles , sectors and locations in the construction and built environment industry . The results showed that areas of particularly strong growth in the construction industry , such as the Middle East , yield higher average salaries than in the UK for example . The average earning for a professional in the construction industry in the Middle East , across all sectors , job types and levels of experience , is £42,090 , compared to £26,719 in the UK . This trend is not necessarily due to the fact that more affluent roles are available , however , as architects with 14 or more years experience working in the Middle East earn on average £43,389 per annum , compared to £40,000 in the UK . Some construction workers in the US/Canada have made more than $ 100,000 annually , depending on their trade .

Construction is one of the most dangerous occupations in the world , incurring more occupational fatalities than any other sector in both the United States and in the European Union . In 2009 , the fatal occupational injury rate among construction workers in the United States was nearly three times that for all workers . Falls are one of the most common causes of fatal and non-fatal injuries among construction workers . Proper safety equipment such as harnesses and guardrails and procedures such as securing ladders and inspecting scaffolding can curtail the risk of occupational injuries in the construction industry . Other major causes of fatalities in the construction industry include electrocution , transportation accidents , and trench cave-ins .

Private schools , also known as independent schools , non-governmental , or nonstate schools , are not administered by local , state or national governments ; thus , they retain the right to select their students and are funded in whole or in part by charging their students tuition , rather than relying on mandatory taxation through public ( government ) funding ; at some private schools students may be able to get a scholarship , which makes the cost cheaper , depending on a talent the student may have ( e.g . sport scholarship , art scholarship , academic scholarship ) , financial need , or tax credit scholarships that might be available .

In the United Kingdom and several other Commonwealth countries including Australia and Canada , the use of the term is generally restricted to primary and secondary educational levels ; it is almost never used of universities and other tertiary institutions . Private education in North America covers the whole gamut of educational activity , ranging from pre-school to tertiary level institutions . Annual tuition fees at K-12 schools range from nothing at so called 'tuition-free ' schools to more than $ 45,000 at several New England preparatory schools .

Religiously affiliated and denominational schools form a subcategory of private schools . Some such schools teach religious education , together with the usual academic subjects to impress their particular faith 's beliefs and traditions in the students who attend . Others use the denomination as more of a general label to describe on what the founders based their belief , while still maintaining a fine distinction between academics and religion . They include parochial schools , a term which is often used to denote Roman Catholic schools . Other religious groups represented in the K-12 private education sector include Protestants , Jews , Muslims and the Orthodox Christians .

Private schools in Australia may be favoured for many reasons : prestige and the social status of the 'old school tie ' ; better quality physical infrastructure and more facilities ( e.g . playing fields , swimming pools , etc . ) , higher-paid teachers ; and/or the belief that private schools offer a higher quality of education . Some schools offer the removal of the purported distractions of co-education ; the presence of boarding facilities ; or stricter discipline based on their power of expulsion , a tool not readily available to government schools . Student uniforms for Australian private schools are generally stricter and more formal than in government schools - for example , a compulsory blazer . Private schools in Australia are always more expensive than their public counterparts . [ citation needed ]

Although most are non-aligned , some of the best known independent schools also belong to the large , long-established religious foundations , such as the Anglican Church , Uniting Church and Presbyterian Church , but in most cases , they do not insist on their students ’ religious allegiance . These schools are typically viewed as 'elite schools ' . Many of the 'grammar schools ' also fall in this category . They are usually expensive schools that tend to be up-market and traditional in style , some Catholic schools fall into this category as well , e.g . St Joseph 's College , Gregory Terrace , Saint Ignatius ' College , Riverview , St Gregory 's College , Campbelltown , St Aloysius ' College ( Sydney ) and St Joseph 's College , Hunters Hill , as well as Loreto Kirribilli , Monte Sant Angelo Mercy College , St Ursula 's College and Loreto Normanhurst for girls .

The right to create private schools in Germany is in Article 7 , Paragraph 4 of the Grundgesetz and can not be suspended even in a state of emergency . It is also not possible to abolish these rights . This unusual protection of private schools was implemented to protect these schools from a second Gleichschaltung or similar event in the future . Still , they are less common than in many other countries . Overall , between 1992 and 2008 the percent of pupils in such schools in Germany increased from 6.1 % to 7.8 % ( including rise from 0.5 % to 6.1 % in the former GDR ) . Percent of students in private high schools reached 11.1 % .

Ersatzschulen are ordinary primary or secondary schools , which are run by private individuals , private organizations or religious groups . These schools offer the same types of diplomas as public schools . Ersatzschulen lack the freedom to operate completely outside of government regulation . Teachers at Ersatzschulen must have at least the same education and at least the same wages as teachers at public schools , an Ersatzschule must have at least the same academic standards as a public school and Article 7 , Paragraph 4 of the Grundgesetz , also forbids segregation of pupils according to the means of their parents ( the so-called Sonderungsverbot ) . Therefore , most Ersatzschulen have very low tuition fees and/or offer scholarships , compared to most other Western European countries . However , it is not possible to finance these schools with such low tuition fees , which is why all German Ersatzschulen are additionally financed with public funds . The percentages of public money could reach 100 % of the personnel expenditures . Nevertheless , Private Schools became insolvent in the past in Germany .

Ergänzungsschulen are secondary or post-secondary ( non-tertiary ) schools , which are run by private individuals , private organizations or rarely , religious groups and offer a type of education which is not available at public schools . Most of these schools are vocational schools . However , these vocational schools are not part of the German dual education system . Ergänzungsschulen have the freedom to operate outside of government regulation and are funded in whole by charging their students tuition fees .

In India , private schools are called independent schools , but since some private schools receive financial aid from the government , it can be an aided or an unaided school . So , in a strict sense , a private school is an unaided independent school . For the purpose of this definition , only receipt of financial aid is considered , not land purchased from the government at a subsidized rate . It is within the power of both the union government and the state governments to govern schools since Education appears in the Concurrent list of legislative subjects in the constitution . The practice has been for the union government to provide the broad policy directions while the states create their own rules and regulations for the administration of the sector . Among other things , this has also resulted in 30 different Examination Boards or academic authorities that conduct examinations for school leaving certificates . Prominent Examination Boards that are present in multiple states are the CBSE and the CISCE , NENBSE

Legally , only non-profit trusts and societies can run schools in India . They will have to satisfy a number of infrastructure and human resource related criteria to get Recognition ( a form of license ) from the government . Critics of this system point out that this leads to corruption by school inspectors who check compliance and to fewer schools in a country that has the largest adult illiterate population in the world . While official data does not capture the real extent of private schooling in the country , various studies have reported unpopularity of government schools and an increasing number of private schools . The Annual Status of Education Report ( ASER ) , which evaluates learning levels in rural India , has been reporting poorer academic achievement in government schools than in private schools . A key difference between the government and private schools is that the medium of education in private schools is English while it is the local language in government schools .

In Ireland , private schools ( Irish : scoil phríobháideach ) are unusual because a certain number of teacher 's salaries are paid by the State . If the school wishes to employ extra teachers they are paid for with school fees , which tend to be relatively low in Ireland compared to the rest of the world . There is , however , a limited element of state assessment of private schools , because of the requirement that the state ensure that children receive a certain minimum education ; Irish private schools must still work towards the Junior Certificate and the Leaving Certificate , for example . Many private schools in Ireland also double as boarding schools . The average fee is around €5,000 annually for most schools , but some of these schools also provide boarding and the fees may then rise up to €25,000 per year . The fee-paying schools are usually run by a religious order , i.e. , the Society of Jesus or Congregation of Christian Brothers , etc .

Many private schools in Ireland also double as boarding schools . The average fee is around €5,000 annually for most schools , but some of these schools also provide boarding and the fees may then rise up to €25,000 per year . The fee-paying schools are usually run by a religious order , i.e. , the Society of Jesus or Congregation of Christian Brothers , etc .
In Ireland , private schools ( Irish : scoil phríobháideach ) are unusual because a certain number of teacher 's salaries are paid by the State .

After Malaysia 's independence in 1957 , the government instructed all schools to surrender their properties and be assimilated into the National School system . This caused an uproar among the Chinese and a compromise was achieved in that the schools would instead become " National Type " schools . Under such a system , the government is only in charge of the school curriculum and teaching personnel while the lands still belonged to the schools . While Chinese primary schools were allowed to retain Chinese as the medium of instruction , Chinese secondary schools are required to change into English-medium schools . Over 60 schools converted to become National Type schools .

The other category of schools are those run and partly or fully funded by private individuals , private organizations and religious groups . The ones that accept government funds are called 'aided ' schools . The private 'un-aided ' schools are fully funded by private parties . The standard and the quality of education is quite high . Technically , these would be categorized as private schools , but many of them have the name " Public School " appended to them , e.g. , the Galaxy Public School in Kathmandu . Most of the middle-class families send their children to such schools , which might be in their own city or far off , like boarding schools . The medium of education is English , but as a compulsory subject , Nepali and/or the state 's official language is also taught . Preschool education is mostly limited to organized neighbourhood nursery schools .

As of April 2014 , there are 88 private schools in New Zealand , catering for around 28,000 students or 3.7 % of the entire student population . Private school numbers have been in decline since the mid-1970s as a result of many private schools opting to become state-integrated schools , mostly due of financial difficulties stemming from changes in student numbers and/or the economy . State-integrated schools keep their private school special character and receives state funds in return for having to operate like a state school , e.g . they must teach the state curriculum , they must employ registered teachers , and they ca n't charge tuition fees ( they can charge " attendance dues " for the upkeep on the still-private school land and buildings ) . The largest decline in private school numbers occurred between 1979 and 1984 , when the nation 's then-private Catholic school system integrated . As a result , private schools in New Zealand are now largely restricted to the largest cities ( Auckland , Hamilton , Wellington and Christchurch ) and niche markets .

In the Philippines , the private sector has been a major provider of educational services , accounting for about 7.5 % of primary enrollment , 32 % of secondary enrollment and about 80 % of tertiary enrollment . Private schools have proven to be efficient in resource utilization . Per unit costs in private schools are generally lower when compared to public schools . This situation is more evident at the tertiary level . Government regulations have given private education more flexibility and autonomy in recent years , notably by lifting the moratorium on applications for new courses , new schools and conversions , by liberalizing tuition fee policy for private schools , by replacing values education for third and fourth years with English , mathematics and natural science at the option of the school , and by issuing the revised Manual of Regulations for Private Schools in August 1992 .

Some of the oldest schools in South Africa are private church schools that were established by missionaries in the early nineteenth century . The private sector has grown ever since . After the abolition of apartheid , the laws governing private education in South Africa changed significantly . The South African Schools Act of 1996 recognises two categories of schools : " public " ( state-controlled ) and " independent " ( which includes traditional private schools and schools which are privately governed [ clarification needed ] . )

In Sweden , pupils are free to choose a private school and the private school gets paid the same amount as municipal schools . Over 10 % of Swedish pupils were enrolled in private schools in 2008 . Sweden is internationally known for this innovative school voucher model that provides Swedish pupils with the opportunity to choose the school they prefer . For instance , the biggest school chain , Kunskapsskolan ( “ The Knowledge School ” ) , offers 30 schools and a web-based environment , has 700 employees and teaches nearly 10,000 pupils . The Swedish system has been recommended to Barack Obama .

Private schools generally prefer to be called independent schools , because of their freedom to operate outside of government and local government control . Some of these are also known as public schools . Preparatory schools in the UK prepare pupils aged up to 13 years old to enter public schools . The name " public school " is based on the fact that the schools were open to pupils from anywhere , and not merely to those from a certain locality , and of any religion or occupation . According to The Good Schools Guide approximately 9 per cent of children being educated in the UK are doing so at fee-paying schools at GSCE level and 13 per cent at A-level . [ citation needed ] Many independent schools are single-sex ( though this is becoming less common ) . Fees range from under £3,000 to £21,000 and above per year for day pupils , rising to £27,000+ per year for boarders . For details in Scotland , see " Meeting the Cost " .

In many parts of the United States , after the 1954 decision in the landmark court case Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka that demanded United States schools desegregate " with all deliberate speed " , local families organized a wave of private " Christian academies " . In much of the U.S. South , many white students migrated to the academies , while public schools became in turn more heavily concentrated with African-American students ( see List of private schools in Mississippi ) . The academic content of the academies was usually College Preparatory . Since the 1970s , many of these " segregation academies " have shut down , although some continue to operate .

Funding for private schools is generally provided through student tuition , endowments , scholarship/voucher funds , and donations and grants from religious organizations or private individuals . Government funding for religious schools is either subject to restrictions or possibly forbidden , according to the courts ' interpretation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment or individual state Blaine Amendments . Non-religious private schools theoretically could qualify for such funding without hassle , preferring the advantages of independent control of their student admissions and course content instead of the public funding they could get with charter status .

Established originally by the Massachusetts legislature and soon thereafter named for John Harvard ( its first benefactor ) , Harvard is the United States ' oldest institution of higher learning , and the Harvard Corporation ( formally , the President and Fellows of Harvard College ) is its first chartered corporation . Although never formally affiliated with any denomination , the early College primarily trained Congregationalist and Unitarian clergy . Its curriculum and student body were gradually secularized during the 18th century , and by the 19th century Harvard had emerged as the central cultural establishment among Boston elites . Following the American Civil War , President Charles W. Eliot 's long tenure ( 1869–1909 ) transformed the college and affiliated professional schools into a modern research university ; Harvard was a founding member of the Association of American Universities in 1900 . James Bryant Conant led the university through the Great Depression and World War II and began to reform the curriculum and liberalize admissions after the war . The undergraduate college became coeducational after its 1977 merger with Radcliffe College .

Throughout the 18th century , Enlightenment ideas of the power of reason and free will became widespread among Congregationalist ministers , putting those ministers and their congregations in tension with more traditionalist , Calvinist parties . :1–4 When the Hollis Professor of Divinity David Tappan died in 1803 and the president of Harvard Joseph Willard died a year later , in 1804 , a struggle broke out over their replacements . Henry Ware was elected to the chair in 1805 , and the liberal Samuel Webber was appointed to the presidency of Harvard two years later , which signaled the changing of the tide from the dominance of traditional ideas at Harvard to the dominance of liberal , Arminian ideas ( defined by traditionalists as Unitarian ideas ) . :4–5:24

In 1846 , the natural history lectures of Louis Agassiz were acclaimed both in New York and on the campus at Harvard College . Agassiz 's approach was distinctly idealist and posited Americans ' " participation in the Divine Nature " and the possibility of understanding " intellectual existences " . Agassiz 's perspective on science combined observation with intuition and the assumption that a person can grasp the " divine plan " in all phenomena . When it came to explaining life-forms , Agassiz resorted to matters of shape based on a presumed archetype for his evidence . This dual view of knowledge was in concert with the teachings of Common Sense Realism derived from Scottish philosophers Thomas Reid and Dugald Stewart , whose works were part of the Harvard curriculum at the time . The popularity of Agassiz 's efforts to " soar with Plato " probably also derived from other writings to which Harvard students were exposed , including Platonic treatises by Ralph Cudworth , John Norrisand , in a Romantic vein , Samuel Coleridge . The library records at Harvard reveal that the writings of Plato and his early modern and Romantic followers were almost as regularly read during the 19th century as those of the " official philosophy " of the more empirical and more deistic Scottish school .
In 1846 , the natural history lectures of Louis Agassiz were acclaimed both in New York and on the campus at Harvard College . Agassiz 's approach was distinctly idealist and posited Americans ' " participation in the Divine Nature " and the possibility of understanding " intellectual existences " . Agassiz 's perspective on science combined observation with intuition and the assumption that a person can grasp the " divine plan " in all phenomena . When it came to explaining life-forms , Agassiz resorted to matters of shape based on a presumed archetype for his evidence . This dual view of knowledge was in concert with the teachings of Common Sense Realism derived from Scottish philosophers Thomas Reid and Dugald Stewart , whose works were part of the Harvard curriculum at the time .

Charles W. Eliot , president 1869–1909 , eliminated the favored position of Christianity from the curriculum while opening it to student self-direction . While Eliot was the most crucial figure in the secularization of American higher education , he was motivated not by a desire to secularize education , but by Transcendentalist Unitarian convictions . Derived from William Ellery Channing and Ralph Waldo Emerson , these convictions were focused on the dignity and worth of human nature , the right and ability of each person to perceive truth , and the indwelling God in each person .
James Bryant Conant ( president , 1933–1953 ) reinvigorated creative scholarship to guarantee its preeminence among research institutions . He saw higher education as a vehicle of opportunity for the talented rather than an entitlement for the wealthy , so Conant devised programs to identify , recruit , and support talented youth . In 1943 , he asked the faculty make a definitive statement about what general education ought to be , at the secondary as well as the college level . The resulting Report , published in 1945 , was one of the most influential manifestos in the history of American education in the 20th century .

Women remained segregated at Radcliffe , though more and more took Harvard classes . Nonetheless , Harvard 's undergraduate population remained predominantly male , with about four men attending Harvard College for every woman studying at Radcliffe . Following the merger of Harvard and Radcliffe admissions in 1977 , the proportion of female undergraduates steadily increased , mirroring a trend throughout higher education in the United States . Harvard 's graduate schools , which had accepted females and other groups in greater numbers even before the college , also became more diverse in the post-World War II period .

Harvard 's 209-acre ( 85 ha ) main campus is centered on Harvard Yard in Cambridge , about 3 miles ( 5 km ) west-northwest of the State House in downtown Boston , and extends into the surrounding Harvard Square neighborhood . Harvard Yard itself contains the central administrative offices and main libraries of the university , academic buildings including Sever Hall and University Hall , Memorial Church , and the majority of the freshman dormitories . Sophomore , junior , and senior undergraduates live in twelve residential Houses , nine of which are south of Harvard Yard along or near the Charles River . The other three are located in a residential neighborhood half a mile northwest of the Yard at the Quadrangle ( commonly referred to as the Quad ) , which formerly housed Radcliffe College students until Radcliffe merged its residential system with Harvard . Each residential house contains rooms for undergraduates , House masters , and resident tutors , as well as a dining hall and library . The facilities were made possible by a gift from Yale University alumnus Edward Harkness .

The Harvard Business School and many of the university 's athletics facilities , including Harvard Stadium , are located on a 358-acre ( 145 ha ) campus opposite the Cambridge campus in Allston . The John W. Weeks Bridge is a pedestrian bridge over the Charles River connecting both campuses . The Harvard Medical School , Harvard School of Dental Medicine , and the Harvard School of Public Health are located on a 21-acre ( 8.5 ha ) campus in the Longwood Medical and Academic Area approximately 3.3 miles ( 5.3 km ) southwest of downtown Boston and 3.3 miles ( 5.3 km ) south of the Cambridge campus .
Harvard has purchased tracts of land in Allston , a walk across the Charles River from Cambridge , with the intent of major expansion southward . The university now owns approximately fifty percent more land in Allston than in Cambridge . Proposals to connect the Cambridge campus with the new Allston campus include new and enlarged bridges , a shuttle service and/or a tram . Plans also call for sinking part of Storrow Drive ( at Harvard 's expense ) for replacement with park land and pedestrian access to the Charles River , as well as the construction of bike paths , and buildings throughout the Allston campus . The institution asserts that such expansion will benefit not only the school , but surrounding community , pointing to such features as the enhanced transit infrastructure , possible shuttles open to the public , and park space which will also be publicly accessible .

Harvard 's 2,400 professors , lecturers , and instructors instruct 7,200 undergraduates and 14,000 graduate students . The school color is crimson , which is also the name of the Harvard sports teams and the daily newspaper , The Harvard Crimson . The color was unofficially adopted ( in preference to magenta ) by an 1875 vote of the student body , although the association with some form of red can be traced back to 1858 , when Charles William Eliot , a young graduate student who would later become Harvard 's 21st and longest-serving president ( 1869–1909 ) , bought red bandanas for his crew so they could more easily be distinguished by spectators at a regatta .

Harvard has the largest university endowment in the world . As of September 2011 [ update ] , it had nearly regained the loss suffered during the 2008 recession . It was worth $ 32 billion in 2011 , up from $ 28 billion in September 2010 and $ 26 billion in 2009 . It suffered about 30 % loss in 2008-09 . In December 2008 , Harvard announced that its endowment had lost 22 % ( approximately $ 8 billion ) from July to October 2008 , necessitating budget cuts . Later reports suggest the loss was actually more than double that figure , a reduction of nearly 50 % of its endowment in the first four months alone . Forbes in March 2009 estimated the loss to be in the range of $ 12 billion . One of the most visible results of Harvard 's attempt to re-balance its budget was their halting of construction of the $ 1.2 billion Allston Science Complex that had been scheduled to be completed by 2011 , resulting in protests from local residents . As of 2012 [ update ] , Harvard University had a total financial aid reserve of $ 159 million for students , and a Pell Grant reserve of $ 4.093 million available for disbursement .

During the divestment from South Africa movement in the late 1980s , student activists erected a symbolic " shantytown " on Harvard Yard and blockaded a speech given by South African Vice Consul Duke Kent-Brown . The Harvard Management Company repeatedly refused to divest , stating that " operating expenses must not be subject to financially unrealistic strictures or carping by the unsophisticated or by special interest groups . " However , the university did eventually reduce its South African holdings by $ 230 million ( out of $ 400 million ) in response to the pressure .
Undergraduate admission to Harvard is characterized by the Carnegie Foundation as " more selective , lower transfer-in " . Harvard College accepted 5.3 % of applicants for the class of 2019 , a record low and the second lowest acceptance rate among all national universities . Harvard College ended its early admissions program in 2007 as the program was believed to disadvantage low-income and under-represented minority applicants applying to selective universities , yet for the class of 2016 an Early Action program was reintroduced .

The four-year , full-time undergraduate program comprises a minority of enrollments at the university and emphasizes instruction with an " arts and sciences focus " . Between 1978 and 2008 , entering students were required to complete a core curriculum of seven classes outside of their concentration . Since 2008 , undergraduate students have been required to complete courses in eight General Education categories : Aesthetic and Interpretive Understanding , Culture and Belief , Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning , Ethical Reasoning , Science of Living Systems , Science of the Physical Universe , Societies of the World , and United States in the World . Harvard offers a comprehensive doctoral graduate program and there is a high level of coexistence between graduate and undergraduate degrees . The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching , The New York Times , and some students have criticized Harvard for its reliance on teaching fellows for some aspects of undergraduate education ; they consider this to adversely affect the quality of education .

Harvard 's academic programs operate on a semester calendar beginning in early September and ending in mid-May . Undergraduates typically take four half-courses per term and must maintain a four-course rate average to be considered full-time . In many concentrations , students can elect to pursue a basic program or an honors-eligible program requiring a senior thesis and/or advanced course work . Students graduating in the top 4–5 % of the class are awarded degrees summa cum laude , students in the next 15 % of the class are awarded magna cum laude , and the next 30 % of the class are awarded cum laude . Harvard has chapters of academic honor societies such as Phi Beta Kappa and various committees and departments also award several hundred named prizes annually . Harvard , along with other universities , has been accused of grade inflation , although there is evidence that the quality of the student body and its motivation have also increased . Harvard College reduced the number of students who receive Latin honors from 90 % in 2004 to 60 % in 2005 . Moreover , the honors of " John Harvard Scholar " and " Harvard College Scholar " will now be given only to the top 5 percent and the next 5 percent of each class .

The Harvard Crimson competes in 42 intercollegiate sports in the NCAA Division I Ivy League . Harvard has an intense athletic rivalry with Yale University culminating in The Game , although the Harvard–Yale Regatta predates the football game . This rivalry , though , is put aside every two years when the Harvard and Yale Track and Field teams come together to compete against a combined Oxford University and Cambridge University team , a competition that is the oldest continuous international amateur competition in the world .

Harvard 's athletic rivalry with Yale is intense in every sport in which they meet , coming to a climax each fall in the annual football meeting , which dates back to 1875 and is usually called simply " The Game " . While Harvard 's football team is no longer one of the country 's best as it often was a century ago during football 's early days ( it won the Rose Bowl in 1920 ) , both it and Yale have influenced the way the game is played . In 1903 , Harvard Stadium introduced a new era into football with the first-ever permanent reinforced concrete stadium of its kind in the country . The stadium 's structure actually played a role in the evolution of the college game . Seeking to reduce the alarming number of deaths and serious injuries in the sport , Walter Camp ( former captain of the Yale football team ) , suggested widening the field to open up the game . But the stadium was too narrow to accommodate a wider playing surface . So , other steps had to be taken . Camp would instead support revolutionary new rules for the 1906 season . These included legalizing the forward pass , perhaps the most significant rule change in the sport 's history .

Jacksonville is in the First Coast region of northeast Florida and is centered on the banks of the St. Johns River , about 25 miles ( 40 km ) south of the Georgia state line and about 340 miles ( 550 km ) north of Miami . The Jacksonville Beaches communities are along the adjacent Atlantic coast . The area was originally inhabited by the Timucua people , and in 1564 was the site of the French colony of Fort Caroline , one of the earliest European settlements in what is now the continental United States . Under British rule , settlement grew at the narrow point in the river where cattle crossed , known as Wacca Pilatka to the Seminole and the Cow Ford to the British . A platted town was established there in 1822 , a year after the United States gained Florida from Spain ; it was named after Andrew Jackson , the first military governor of the Florida Territory and seventh President of the United States .

Harbor improvements since the late 19th century have made Jacksonville a major military and civilian deep-water port . Its riverine location facilitates two United States Navy bases and the Port of Jacksonville , Florida 's third largest seaport . The two US Navy bases , Blount Island Command and the nearby Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay form the third largest military presence in the United States . Significant factors in the local economy include services such as banking , insurance , healthcare and logistics . As with much of Florida , tourism is also important to the Jacksonville area , particularly tourism related to golf . People from Jacksonville may be called " Jacksonvillians " or " Jaxsons " ( also spelled " Jaxons " ) .

The area of the modern city of Jacksonville has been inhabited for thousands of years . On Black Hammock Island in the national Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve , a University of North Florida team discovered some of the oldest remnants of pottery in the United States , dating to 2500 BC . In the 16th century , the beginning of the historical era , the region was inhabited by the Mocama , a coastal subgroup of the Timucua people . At the time of contact with Europeans , all Mocama villages in present-day Jacksonville were part of the powerful chiefdom known as the Saturiwa , centered around the mouth of the St. Johns River . One early map shows a village called Ossachite at the site of what is now downtown Jacksonville ; this may be the earliest recorded name for that area .

In the 16th century , the beginning of the historical era , the region was inhabited by the Mocama , a coastal subgroup of the Timucua people . At the time of contact with Europeans , all Mocama villages in present-day Jacksonville were part of the powerful chiefdom known as the Saturiwa , centered around the mouth of the St. Johns River . One early map shows a village called Ossachite at the site of what is now downtown Jacksonville ; this may be the earliest recorded name for that area .

French Huguenot explorer Jean Ribault charted the St. Johns River in 1562 calling it the River of May because he discovered it in May . Ribault erected a stone column near present-day Jacksonville claiming the newly discovered land for France . In 1564 , René Goulaine de Laudonnière established the first European settlement , Fort Caroline , on the St. Johns near the main village of the Saturiwa . Philip II of Spain ordered Pedro Menéndez de Avilés to protect the interest of Spain by attacking the French presence at Fort Caroline . On September 20 , 1565 , a Spanish force from the nearby Spanish settlement of St. Augustine attacked Fort Caroline , and killed nearly all the French soldiers defending it . The Spanish renamed the fort San Mateo , and following the ejection of the French , St. Augustine 's position as the most important settlement in Florida was solidified . The location of Fort Caroline is subject to debate but a reconstruction of the fort was established on the St. Johns River in 1964 .

Spain ceded Florida to the British in 1763 after the French and Indian War , and the British soon constructed the King 's Road connecting St. Augustine to Georgia . The road crossed the St. Johns River at a narrow point , which the Seminole called Wacca Pilatka and the British called the Cow Ford or Cowford ; these names ostensibly reflect the fact that cattle were brought across the river there . The British introduced the cultivation of sugar cane , indigo and fruits as well the export of lumber . As a result , the northeastern Florida area prospered economically more than it had under the Spanish . Britain ceded control of the territory back to Spain in 1783 , after its defeat in the American Revolutionary War , and the settlement at the Cow Ford continued to grow . After Spain ceded the Florida Territory to the United States in 1821 , American settlers on the north side of the Cow Ford decided to plan a town , laying out the streets and plats . They soon named the town Jacksonville , after Andrew Jackson . Led by Isaiah D. Hart , residents wrote a charter for a town government , which was approved by the Florida Legislative Council on February 9 , 1832 .

During the American Civil War , Jacksonville was a key supply point for hogs and cattle being shipped from Florida to aid the Confederate cause . The city was blockaded by Union forces , who gained control of the nearby Fort Clinch . Though no battles were fought in Jacksonville proper , the city changed hands several times between Union and Confederate forces . The Skirmish of the Brick Church in 1862 just outside Jacksonville proper resulted in the first Confederate victory in Florida . In February 1864 Union forces left Jacksonville and confronted a Confederate Army at the Battle of Olustee resulting in a Confederate victory . Union forces then retreated to Jacksonville and held the city for the remainder of the war . In March 1864 a Confederate cavalry confronted a Union expedition resulting in the Battle of Cedar Creek . Warfare and the long occupation left the city disrupted after the war .

During Reconstruction and the Gilded Age , Jacksonville and nearby St. Augustine became popular winter resorts for the rich and famous . Visitors arrived by steamboat and later by railroad . President Grover Cleveland attended the Sub-Tropical Exposition in the city on February 22 , 1888 during his trip to Florida . This highlighted the visibility of the state as a worthy place for tourism . The city 's tourism , however , was dealt major blows in the late 19th century by yellow fever outbreaks . In addition , extension of the Florida East Coast Railway further south drew visitors to other areas . From 1893 to 1938 Jacksonville was the site of the Florida Old Confederate Soldiers and Sailors Home with a nearby cemetery .

On May 3 , 1901 , downtown Jacksonville was ravaged by a fire that started as a kitchen fire . Spanish moss at a nearby mattress factory was quickly engulfed in flames and enabling the fire to spread rapidly . In just eight hours , it swept through 146 city blocks , destroyed over 2,000 buildings , left about 10,000 homeless and killed 7 residents . The Confederate Monument in Hemming Park was one of the only landmarks to survive the fire . Governor Jennings declare martial law and sent the state militia to maintain order . On May 17 municipal authority resumed in Jacksonville . It is said the glow from the flames could be seen in Savannah , Georgia , and the smoke plumes seen in Raleigh , North Carolina . Known as the " Great Fire of 1901 " , it was one of the worst disasters in Florida history and the largest urban fire in the southeastern United States . Architect Henry John Klutho was a primary figure in the reconstruction of the city . The first multi-story structure built by Klutho was the Dyal-Upchurch Building in 1902 . The St. James Building , built on the previous site of the St. James Hotel that burned down , was built in 1912 as Klutho 's crowning achievement .

In the 1910s , New York–based filmmakers were attracted to Jacksonville 's warm climate , exotic locations , excellent rail access , and cheap labor . Over the course of the decade , more than 30 silent film studios were established , earning Jacksonville the title of " Winter Film Capital of the World " . However , the emergence of Hollywood as a major film production center ended the city 's film industry . One converted movie studio site , Norman Studios , remains in Arlington ; It has been converted to the Jacksonville Silent Film Museum at Norman Studios .

Jacksonville , like most large cities in the United States , suffered from negative effects of rapid urban sprawl after World War II . The construction of highways led residents to move to newer housing in the suburbs . After World War II , the government of the city of Jacksonville began to increase spending to fund new public building projects in the boom that occurred after the war . Mayor W. Haydon Burns ' Jacksonville Story resulted in the construction of a new city hall , civic auditorium , public library and other projects that created a dynamic sense of civic pride . However , the development of suburbs and a subsequent wave of middle class " white flight " left Jacksonville with a much poorer population than before . The city 's most populous ethnic group , non-Hispanic white , declined from 75.8 % in 1970 to 55.1 % by 2010 .

Much of the city 's tax base dissipated , leading to problems with funding education , sanitation , and traffic control within the city limits . In addition , residents in unincorporated suburbs had difficulty obtaining municipal services , such as sewage and building code enforcement . In 1958 , a study recommended that the city of Jacksonville begin annexing outlying communities in order to create the needed tax base to improve services throughout the county . Voters outside the city limits rejected annexation plans in six referendums between 1960 and 1965 .
In the mid-1960s , corruption scandals began to arise among many of the city 's officials , who were mainly elected through the traditional old boy network . After a grand jury was convened to investigate , 11 officials were indicted and more were forced to resign . Jacksonville Consolidation , led by J. J. Daniel and Claude Yates , began to win more support during this period , from both inner city blacks , who wanted more involvement in government , and whites in the suburbs , who wanted more services and more control over the central city . In 1964 all 15 of Duval County 's public high schools lost their accreditation . This added momentum to proposals for government reform . Lower taxes , increased economic development , unification of the community , better public spending and effective administration by a more central authority were all cited as reasons for a new consolidated government .

When a consolidation referendum was held in 1967 , voters approved the plan . On October 1 , 1968 , the governments merged to create the Consolidated City of Jacksonville . Fire , police , health & welfare , recreation , public works , and housing & urban development were all combined under the new government . In honor of the occasion , then-Mayor Hans Tanzler posed with actress Lee Meredith behind a sign marking the new border of the " Bold New City of the South " at Florida 13 and Julington Creek . The Better Jacksonville Plan , promoted as a blueprint for Jacksonville 's future and approved by Jacksonville voters in 2000 , authorized a half-penny sales tax . This would generate most of the revenue required for the $ 2.25 billion package of major projects that included road & infrastructure improvements , environmental preservation , targeted economic development and new or improved public facilities .

Like much of the south Atlantic region of the United States , Jacksonville has a humid subtropical climate ( Köppen Cfa ) , with mild weather during winters and hot and humid weather during summers . Seasonal rainfall is concentrated in the warmest months from May through September , while the driest months are from November through April . Due to Jacksonville 's low latitude and coastal location , the city sees very little cold weather , and winters are typically mild and sunny . Summers can be hot and wet , and summer thunderstorms with torrential but brief downpours are common .

Mean monthly temperatures range from around 53 F in January to 82 F in July . High temperatures average 64 to 92 °F ( 18 to 33 °C ) throughout the year . High heat indices are common for the summer months in the area , with indices above 110 °F ( 43.3 °C ) possible . The highest temperature recorded was 104 °F ( 40 °C ) on July 11 , 1879 and July 28 , 1872 . It is common for thunderstorms to erupt during a typical summer afternoon . These are caused by the rapid heating of the land relative to the water , combined with extremely high humidity .

Jacksonville has suffered less damage from hurricanes than most other east coast cities , although the threat does exist for a direct hit by a major hurricane . The city has only received one direct hit from a hurricane since 1871 ; however , Jacksonville has experienced hurricane or near-hurricane conditions more than a dozen times due to storms crossing the state from the Gulf of Mexico to the Atlantic Ocean , or passing to the north or south in the Atlantic and brushing past the area . The strongest effect on Jacksonville was from Hurricane Dora in 1964 , the only recorded storm to hit the First Coast with sustained hurricane-force winds . The eye crossed St. Augustine with winds that had just barely diminished to 110 mph ( 180 km/h ) , making it a strong Category 2 on the Saffir-Simpson Scale . Jacksonville also suffered damage from 2008 's Tropical Storm Fay which crisscrossed the state , bringing parts of Jacksonville under darkness for four days . Similarly , four years prior to this , Jacksonville was inundated by Hurricane Frances and Hurricane Jeanne , which made landfall south of the area . These tropical cyclones were the costliest indirect hits to Jacksonville . Hurricane Floyd in 1999 caused damage mainly to Jacksonville Beach . During Floyd , the Jacksonville Beach pier was severely damaged , and later demolished . The rebuilt pier was later damaged by Fay , but not destroyed . Tropical Storm Bonnie would cause minor damage in 2004 , spawning a minor tornado in the process . On May 28 , 2012 , Jacksonville was hit by Tropical Storm Beryl , packing winds up to 70 miles per hour ( 113 km/h ) which made landfall near Jacksonville Beach .

A study by the World Institute for Development Economics Research at United Nations University reports that the richest 1 % of adults alone owned 40 % of global assets in the year 2000 . The three richest people in the world possess more financial assets than the lowest 48 nations combined . The combined wealth of the " 10 million dollar millionaires " grew to nearly $ 41 trillion in 2008 . A January 2014 report by Oxfam claims that the 85 wealthiest individuals in the world have a combined wealth equal to that of the bottom 50 % of the world 's population , or about 3.5 billion people . According to a Los Angeles Times analysis of the report , the wealthiest 1 % owns 46 % of the world 's wealth ; the 85 richest people , a small part of the wealthiest 1 % , own about 0.7 % of the human population 's wealth , which is the same as the bottom half of the population . More recently , in January 2015 , Oxfam reported that the wealthiest 1 percent will own more than half of the global wealth by 2016 . An October 2014 study by Credit Suisse also claims that the top 1 % now own nearly half of the world 's wealth and that the accelerating disparity could trigger a recession . In October 2015 , Credit Suisse published a study which shows global inequality continues to increase , and that half of the world 's wealth is now in the hands of those in the top percentile , whose assets each exceed $ 759,900 . A 2016 report by Oxfam claims that the 62 wealthiest individuals own as much wealth as the poorer half of the global population combined . Oxfam 's claims have however been questioned on the basis of the methodology used : by using net wealth ( adding up assets and subtracting debts ) , the Oxfam report , for instance , finds that there are more poor people in the United States and Western Europe than in China ( due to a greater tendency to take on debts ) .

Neoclassical economics views inequalities in the distribution of income as arising from differences in value added by labor , capital and land . Within labor income distribution is due to differences in value added by different classifications of workers . In this perspective , wages and profits are determined by the marginal value added of each economic actor ( worker , capitalist/business owner , landlord ) . Thus , in a market economy , inequality is a reflection of the productivity gap between highly-paid professions and lower-paid professions .

In Marxian analysis , capitalist firms increasingly substitute capital equipment for labor inputs ( workers ) under competitive pressure to reduce costs and maximize profits . Over the long-term , this trend increases the organic composition of capital , meaning that less workers are required in proportion to capital inputs , increasing unemployment ( the " reserve army of labour " ) . This process exerts a downward pressure on wages . The substitution of capital equipment for labor ( mechanization and automation ) raises the productivity of each worker , resulting in a situation of relatively stagnant wages for the working class amidst rising levels of property income for the capitalist class .

In a purely capitalist mode of production ( i.e . where professional and labor organizations can not limit the number of workers ) the workers wages will not be controlled by these organizations , or by the employer , but rather by the market . Wages work in the same way as prices for any other good . Thus , wages can be considered as a function of market price of skill . And therefore , inequality is driven by this price . Under the law of supply and demand , the price of skill is determined by a race between the demand for the skilled worker and the supply of the skilled worker . " On the other hand , markets can also concentrate wealth , pass environmental costs on to society , and abuse workers and consumers . " " Markets , by themselves , even when they are stable , often lead to high levels of inequality , outcomes that are widely viewed as unfair . " Employers who offer a below market wage will find that their business is chronically understaffed . Their competitors will take advantage of the situation by offering a higher wage the best of their labor . For a businessman who has the profit motive as the prime interest , it is a losing proposition to offer below or above market wages to workers .

A job where there are many workers willing to work a large amount of time ( high supply ) competing for a job that few require ( low demand ) will result in a low wage for that job . This is because competition between workers drives down the wage . An example of this would be jobs such as dish-washing or customer service . Competition amongst workers tends to drive down wages due to the expendable nature of the worker in relation to his or her particular job . A job where there are few able or willing workers ( low supply ) , but a large need for the positions ( high demand ) , will result in high wages for that job . This is because competition between employers for employees will drive up the wage . Examples of this would include jobs that require highly developed skills , rare abilities , or a high level of risk . Competition amongst employers tends to drive up wages due to the nature of the job , since there is a relative shortage of workers for the particular position . Professional and labor organizations may limit the supply of workers which results in higher demand and greater incomes for members . Members may also receive higher wages through collective bargaining , political influence , or corruption .

On the other hand , higher economic inequality tends to increase entrepreneurship rates at the individual level ( self-employment ) . However , most of it is often based on necessity rather than opportunity . Necessity-based entrepreneurship is motivated by survival needs such as income for food and shelter ( " push " motivations ) , whereas opportunity-based entrepreneurship is driven by achievement-oriented motivations ( " pull " ) such as vocation and more likely to involve the pursue of new products , services , or underserved market needs . The economic impact of the former type of entrepreneurialism tends to be redistributive while the latter is expected to foster technological progress and thus have a more positive impact on economic growth .

Another cause is the rate at which income is taxed coupled with the progressivity of the tax system . A progressive tax is a tax by which the tax rate increases as the taxable base amount increases . In a progressive tax system , the level of the top tax rate will often have a direct impact on the level of inequality within a society , either increasing it or decreasing it , provided that income does not change as a result of the change in tax regime . Additionally , steeper tax progressivity applied to social spending can result in a more equal distribution of income across the board . The difference between the Gini index for an income distribution before taxation and the Gini index after taxation is an indicator for the effects of such taxation .

An important factor in the creation of inequality is variation in individuals ' access to education . Education , especially in an area where there is a high demand for workers , creates high wages for those with this education , however , increases in education first increase and then decrease growth as well as income inequality . As a result , those who are unable to afford an education , or choose not to pursue optional education , generally receive much lower wages . The justification for this is that a lack of education leads directly to lower incomes , and thus lower aggregate savings and investment . Conversely , education raises incomes and promotes growth because it helps to unleash the productive potential of the poor .

An important factor in the creation of inequality is variation in individuals ' access to education . Education , especially in an area where there is a high demand for workers , creates high wages for those with this education , however , increases in education first increase and then decrease growth as well as income inequality . As a result , those who are unable to afford an education , or choose not to pursue optional education , generally receive much lower wages . The justification for this is that a lack of education leads directly to lower incomes , and thus lower aggregate savings and investment . Conversely , education raises incomes and promotes growth because it helps to unleash the productive potential of the poor .

In 2014 , economists with the Standard & Poor 's rating agency concluded that the widening disparity between the U.S. 's wealthiest citizens and the rest of the nation had slowed its recovery from the 2008-2009 recession and made it more prone to boom-and-bust cycles . To partially remedy the wealth gap and the resulting slow growth , S & P recommended increasing access to education . It estimated that if the average United States worker had completed just one more year of school , it would add an additional $ 105 billion in growth to the country 's economy over five years .

During the mass high school education movement from 1910–1940 , there was an increase in skilled workers , which led to a decrease in the price of skilled labor . High school education during the period was designed to equip students with necessary skill sets to be able to perform at work . In fact , it differs from the present high school education , which is regarded as a stepping-stone to acquire college and advanced degrees . This decrease in wages caused a period of compression and decreased inequality between skilled and unskilled workers . Education is very important for the growth of the economy , however educational inequality in gender also influence towards the economy . Lagerlof and Galor stated that gender inequality in education can result to low economic growth , and continued gender inequality in education , thus creating a poverty trap . It is suggested that a large gap in male and female education may indicate backwardness and so may be associated with lower economic growth , which can explain why there is economic inequality between countries .

John Schmitt and Ben Zipperer ( 2006 ) of the CEPR point to economic liberalism and the reduction of business regulation along with the decline of union membership as one of the causes of economic inequality . In an analysis of the effects of intensive Anglo-American liberal policies in comparison to continental European liberalism , where unions have remained strong , they concluded " The U.S. economic and social model is associated with substantial levels of social exclusion , including high levels of income inequality , high relative and absolute poverty rates , poor and unequal educational outcomes , poor health outcomes , and high rates of crime and incarceration . At the same time , the available evidence provides little support for the view that U.S.-style labor-market flexibility dramatically improves labor-market outcomes . Despite popular prejudices to the contrary , the U.S. economy consistently affords a lower level of economic mobility than all the continental European countries for which data is available . "

Sociologist Jake Rosenfield of the University of Washington asserts that the decline of organized labor in the United States has played a more significant role in expanding the income gap than technological changes and globalization , which were also experienced by other industrialized nations that did n't experience steep surges in inequality . He points out that nations with high rates of unionization , particularly in Scandinavia , have very low levels of inequality , and concludes " the historical pattern is clear ; the cross-national pattern is clear : high inequality goes hand-in-hand with weak labor movements and vice-versa .

Trade liberalization may shift economic inequality from a global to a domestic scale . When rich countries trade with poor countries , the low-skilled workers in the rich countries may see reduced wages as a result of the competition , while low-skilled workers in the poor countries may see increased wages . Trade economist Paul Krugman estimates that trade liberalisation has had a measurable effect on the rising inequality in the United States . He attributes this trend to increased trade with poor countries and the fragmentation of the means of production , resulting in low skilled jobs becoming more tradeable . However , he concedes that the effect of trade on inequality in America is minor when compared to other causes , such as technological innovation , a view shared by other experts . Empirical economists Max Roser and Jesus Crespo-Cuaresma find support in the data that international trade is increasing income inequality . They empirically confirm the predictions of the Stolper–Samuelson theorem regarding the effects of international trade on the distribution of incomes . Lawrence Katz estimates that trade has only accounted for 5-15 % of rising income inequality . Robert Lawrence argues that technological innovation and automation has meant that low-skilled jobs have been replaced by machine labor in wealthier nations , and that wealthier countries no longer have significant numbers of low-skilled manufacturing workers that could be affected by competition from poor countries .

In many countries , there is a Gender pay gap in favor of males in the labor market . Several factors other than discrimination may contribute to this gap . On average , women are more likely than men to consider factors other than pay when looking for work , and may be less willing to travel or relocate . Thomas Sowell , in his book Knowledge and Decisions , claims that this difference is due to women not taking jobs due to marriage or pregnancy , but income studies show that that does not explain the entire difference . A U.S. Census 's report stated that in US once other factors are accounted for there is still a difference in earnings between women and men . The income gap in other countries ranges from 53 % in Botswana to -40 % in Bahrain .

Economist Simon Kuznets argued that levels of economic inequality are in large part the result of stages of development . According to Kuznets , countries with low levels of development have relatively equal distributions of wealth . As a country develops , it acquires more capital , which leads to the owners of this capital having more wealth and income and introducing inequality . Eventually , through various possible redistribution mechanisms such as social welfare programs , more developed countries move back to lower levels of inequality .

Plotting the relationship between level of income and inequality , Kuznets saw middle-income developing economies level of inequality bulging out to form what is now known as the Kuznets curve . Kuznets demonstrated this relationship using cross-sectional data . However , more recent testing of this theory with superior panel data has shown it to be very weak .

Wealth concentration is a theoretical [ according to whom ? ] process by which , under certain conditions , newly created wealth concentrates in the possession of already-wealthy individuals or entities . According to this theory , those who already hold wealth have the means to invest in new sources of creating wealth or to otherwise leverage the accumulation of wealth , thus are the beneficiaries of the new wealth . Over time , wealth condensation can significantly contribute to the persistence of inequality within society . Thomas Piketty in his book Capital in the Twenty-First Century argues that the fundamental force for divergence is the usually greater return of capital ( r ) than economic growth ( g ) , and that larger fortunes generate higher returns [ pp . 384 Table 12.2 , U.S. university endowment size vs. real annual rate of return ]

Effects of inequality researchers have found include higher rates of health and social problems , and lower rates of social goods , a lower level of economic utility in society from resources devoted on high-end consumption , and even a lower level of economic growth when human capital is neglected for high-end consumption . For the top 21 industrialised countries , counting each person equally , life expectancy is lower in more unequal countries ( r = -.907 ) . A similar relationship exists among US states ( r = -.620 ) .

2013 Economics Nobel prize winner Robert J. Shiller said that rising inequality in the United States and elsewhere is the most important problem . Increasing inequality harms economic growth . High and persistent unemployment , in which inequality increases , has a negative effect on subsequent long-run economic growth . Unemployment can harm growth not only because it is a waste of resources , but also because it generates redistributive pressures and subsequent distortions , drives people to poverty , constrains liquidity limiting labor mobility , and erodes self-esteem promoting social dislocation , unrest and conflict . Policies aiming at controlling unemployment and in particular at reducing its inequality-associated effects support economic growth .

British researchers Richard G. Wilkinson and Kate Pickett have found higher rates of health and social problems ( obesity , mental illness , homicides , teenage births , incarceration , child conflict , drug use ) , and lower rates of social goods ( life expectancy by country , educational performance , trust among strangers , women 's status , social mobility , even numbers of patents issued ) in countries and states with higher inequality . Using statistics from 23 developed countries and the 50 states of the US , they found social/health problems lower in countries like Japan and Finland and states like Utah and New Hampshire with high levels of equality , than in countries ( US and UK ) and states ( Mississippi and New York ) with large differences in household income .

For most of human history higher material living standards – full stomachs , access to clean water and warmth from fuel – led to better health and longer lives . This pattern of higher incomes-longer lives still holds among poorer countries , where life expectancy increases rapidly as per capita income increases , but in recent decades it has slowed down among middle income countries and plateaued among the richest thirty or so countries in the world . Americans live no longer on average ( about 77 years in 2004 ) than Greeks ( 78 years ) or New Zealanders ( 78 ) , though the USA has a higher GDP per capita . Life expectancy in Sweden ( 80 years ) and Japan ( 82 ) – where income was more equally distributed – was longer .

In recent years the characteristic that has strongly correlated with health in developed countries is income inequality . Creating an index of " Health and Social Problems " from nine factors , authors Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett found health and social problems " more common in countries with bigger income inequalities " , and more common among states in the US with larger income inequalities . Other studies have confirmed this relationship . The UNICEF index of " child well-being in rich countries " , studying 40 indicators in 22 countries , correlates with greater equality but not per capita income .

Crime rate has also been shown to be correlated with inequality in society . Most studies looking into the relationship have concentrated on homicides – since homicides are almost identically defined across all nations and jurisdictions . There have been over fifty studies showing tendencies for violence to be more common in societies where income differences are larger . Research has been conducted comparing developed countries with undeveloped countries , as well as studying areas within countries . Daly et al . 2001 found that among U.S States and Canadian Provinces there is a tenfold difference in homicide rates related to inequality . They estimated that about half of all variation in homicide rates can be accounted for by differences in the amount of inequality in each province or state . Fajnzylber et al . ( 2002 ) found a similar relationship worldwide . Among comments in academic literature on the relationship between homicides and inequality are :

Following the utilitarian principle of seeking the greatest good for the greatest number – economic inequality is problematic . A house that provides less utility to a millionaire as a summer home than it would to a homeless family of five , is an example of reduced " distributive efficiency " within society , that decreases marginal utility of wealth and thus the sum total of personal utility . An additional dollar spent by a poor person will go to things providing a great deal of utility to that person , such as basic necessities like food , water , and healthcare ; while , an additional dollar spent by a much richer person will very likely go to luxury items providing relatively less utility to that person . Thus , the marginal utility of wealth per person ( " the additional dollar " ) decreases as a person becomes richer . From this standpoint , for any given amount of wealth in society , a society with more equality will have higher aggregate utility . Some studies have found evidence for this theory , noting that in societies where inequality is lower , population-wide satisfaction and happiness tend to be higher .

Conservative researchers have argued that income inequality is not significant because consumption , rather than income should be the measure of inequality , and inequality of consumption is less extreme than inequality of income in the US . Will Wilkinson of the libertarian Cato Institute states that " the weight of the evidence shows that the run-up in consumption inequality has been considerably less dramatic than the rise in income inequality , " and consumption is more important than income . According to Johnson , Smeeding , and Tory , consumption inequality was actually lower in 2001 than it was in 1986 . The debate is summarized in " The Hidden Prosperity of the Poor " by journalist Thomas B. Edsall . Other studies have not found consumption inequality less dramatic than household income inequality , and the CBO 's study found consumption data not " adequately " capturing " consumption by high-income households " as it does their income , though it did agree that household consumption numbers show more equal distribution than household income .

Conservative researchers have argued that income inequality is not significant because consumption , rather than income should be the measure of inequality , and inequality of consumption is less extreme than inequality of income in the US . Will Wilkinson of the libertarian Cato Institute states that " the weight of the evidence shows that the run-up in consumption inequality has been considerably less dramatic than the rise in income inequality , " and consumption is more important than income . According to Johnson , Smeeding , and Tory , consumption inequality was actually lower in 2001 than it was in 1986 .

Central Banking economist Raghuram Rajan argues that " systematic economic inequalities , within the United States and around the world , have created deep financial 'fault lines ' that have made [ financial ] crises more likely to happen than in the past " – the Financial crisis of 2007–08 being the most recent example . To compensate for stagnating and declining purchasing power , political pressure has developed to extend easier credit to the lower and middle income earners – particularly to buy homes – and easier credit in general to keep unemployment rates low . This has given the American economy a tendency to go " from bubble to bubble " fueled by unsustainable monetary stimulation .

According to International Monetary Fund economists , inequality in wealth and income is negatively correlated with the duration of economic growth spells ( not the rate of growth ) . High levels of inequality prevent not just economic prosperity , but also the quality of a country 's institutions and high levels of education . According to IMF staff economists , " if the income share of the top 20 percent ( the rich ) increases , then GDP growth actually declines over the medium term , suggesting that the benefits do not trickle down . In contrast , an increase in the income share of the bottom 20 percent ( the poor ) is associated with higher GDP growth . The poor and the middle class matter the most for growth via a number of interrelated economic , social , and political channels . "

According to economists David Castells-Quintana and Vicente Royuela , increasing inequality harms economic growth . High and persistent unemployment , in which inequality increases , has a negative effect on subsequent long-run economic growth . Unemployment can harm growth not only because it is a waste of resources , but also because it generates redistributive pressures and subsequent distortions , drives people to poverty , constrains liquidity limiting labor mobility , and erodes self-esteem promoting social dislocation , unrest and conflict . Policies aiming at controlling unemployment and in particular at reducing its inequality-associated effects support economic growth .

Economist Joseph Stiglitz presented evidence in 2009 that both global inequality and inequality within countries prevent growth by limiting aggregate demand . Economist Branko Milanovic , wrote in 2001 that , " The view that income inequality harms growth – or that improved equality can help sustain growth – has become more widely held in recent years . ... The main reason for this shift is the increasing importance of human capital in development . When physical capital mattered most , savings and investments were key . Then it was important to have a large contingent of rich people who could save a greater proportion of their income than the poor and invest it in physical capital . But now that human capital is scarcer than machines , widespread education has become the secret to growth . "

In 1993 , Galor and Zeira showed that inequality in the presence of credit market imperfections has a long lasting detrimental effect on human capital formation and economic development . A 1996 study by Perotti examined the channels through which inequality may affect economic growth . He showed that , in accordance with the credit market imperfection approach , inequality is associated with lower level of human capital formation ( education , experience , and apprenticeship ) and higher level of fertility , and thereby lower levels of growth . He found that inequality is associated with higher levels of redistributive taxation , which is associated with lower levels of growth from reductions in private savings and investment . Perotti concluded that , " more equal societies have lower fertility rates and higher rates of investment in education . Both are reflected in higher rates of growth . Also , very unequal societies tend to be politically and socially unstable , which is reflected in lower rates of investment and therefore growth . "

Research by Harvard economist Robert Barro , found that there is " little overall relation between income inequality and rates of growth and investment " . According to work by Barro in 1999 and 2000 , high levels of inequality reduce growth in relatively poor countries but encourage growth in richer countries . A study of Swedish counties between 1960 and 2000 found a positive impact of inequality on growth with lead times of five years or less , but no correlation after ten years . Studies of larger data sets have found no correlations for any fixed lead time , and a negative impact on the duration of growth .

Studies on income inequality and growth have sometimes found evidence confirming the Kuznets curve hypothesis , which states that with economic development , inequality first increases , then decreases . Economist Thomas Piketty challenges this notion , claiming that from 1914 to 1945 wars and " violent economic and political shocks " reduced inequality . Moreover , Piketty argues that the " magical " Kuznets curve hypothesis , with its emphasis on the balancing of economic growth in the long run , can not account for the significant increase in economic inequality throughout the developed world since the 1970s .

Some theories developed in the 1970s established possible avenues through which inequality may have a positive effect on economic development . According to a 1955 review , savings by the wealthy , if these increase with inequality , were thought to offset reduced consumer demand . A 2013 report on Nigeria suggests that growth has risen with increased income inequality . Some theories popular from the 1950s to 2011 incorrectly stated that inequality had a positive effect on economic development . Analyses based on comparing yearly equality figures to yearly growth rates were misleading because it takes several years for effects to manifest as changes to economic growth . IMF economists found a strong association between lower levels of inequality in developing countries and sustained periods of economic growth . Developing countries with high inequality have " succeeded in initiating growth at high rates for a few years " but " longer growth spells are robustly associated with more equality in the income distribution .

While acknowledging the central role economic growth can potentially play in human development , poverty reduction and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals , it is becoming widely understood amongst the development community that special efforts must be made to ensure poorer sections of society are able to participate in economic growth . The effect of economic growth on poverty reduction – the growth elasticity of poverty – can depend on the existing level of inequality . For instance , with low inequality a country with a growth rate of 2 % per head and 40 % of its population living in poverty , can halve poverty in ten years , but a country with high inequality would take nearly 60 years to achieve the same reduction . In the words of the Secretary General of the United Nations Ban Ki-Moon : " While economic growth is necessary , it is not sufficient for progress on reducing poverty . "

In many poor and developing countries much land and housing is held outside the formal or legal property ownership registration system . Much unregistered property is held in informal form through various associations and other arrangements . Reasons for extra-legal ownership include excessive bureaucratic red tape in buying property and building , In some countries it can take over 200 steps and up to 14 years to build on government land . Other causes of extra-legal property are failures to notarize transaction documents or having documents notarized but failing to have them recorded with the official agency .

A number of researchers ( David Rodda , Jacob Vigdor , and Janna Matlack ) , argue that a shortage of affordable housing – at least in the US – is caused in part by income inequality . David Rodda noted that from 1984 and 1991 , the number of quality rental units decreased as the demand for higher quality housing increased ( Rhoda 1994:148 ) . Through gentrification of older neighbourhoods , for example , in East New York , rental prices increased rapidly as landlords found new residents willing to pay higher market rate for housing and left lower income families without rental units . The ad valorem property tax policy combined with rising prices made it difficult or impossible for low income residents to keep pace .

Firstly , certain costs are difficult to avoid and are shared by everyone , such as the costs of housing , pensions , education and health care . If the state does not provide these services , then for those on lower incomes , the costs must be borrowed and often those on lower incomes are those who are worse equipped to manage their finances . Secondly , aspirational consumption describes the process of middle income earners aspiring to achieve the standards of living enjoyed by their wealthier counterparts and one method of achieving this aspiration is by taking on debt . The result leads to even greater inequality and potential economic instability .

The smaller the economic inequality , the more waste and pollution is created , resulting in many cases , in more environmental degradation . This can be explained by the fact that as the poor people in the society become more wealthy , it increases their yearly carbon emissions . This relation is expressed by the Environmental Kuznets Curve ( EKC ) . [ not in citation given ] It should be noted here however that in certain cases , with great economic inequality , there is nonetheless not more waste and pollution created as the waste/pollution is cleaned up better afterwards ( water treatment , filtering , ... ) ... . Also note that the whole of the increase in environmental degradation is the result of the increase of emissions per person being multiplied by a multiplier . If there were fewer people however , this multiplier would be lower , and thus the amount of environmental degradation would be lower as well . As such , the current high level of population has a large impact on this as well . If ( as WWF argued ) , population levels would start to drop to a sustainable level ( 1/3 of current levels , so about 2 billion people ) , human inequality can be addressed/corrected , while still not resulting in an increase of environmental damage .

Socialists attribute the vast disparities in wealth to the private ownership of the means of production by a class of owners , creating a situation where a small portion of the population lives off unearned property income by virtue of ownership titles in capital equipment , financial assets and corporate stock . By contrast , the vast majority of the population is dependent on income in the form of a wage or salary . In order to rectify this situation , socialists argue that the means of production should be socially owned so that income differentials would be reflective of individual contributions to the social product .

Robert Nozick argued that government redistributes wealth by force ( usually in the form of taxation ) , and that the ideal moral society would be one where all individuals are free from force . However , Nozick recognized that some modern economic inequalities were the result of forceful taking of property , and a certain amount of redistribution would be justified to compensate for this force but not because of the inequalities themselves . John Rawls argued in A Theory of Justice that inequalities in the distribution of wealth are only justified when they improve society as a whole , including the poorest members . Rawls does not discuss the full implications of his theory of justice . Some see Rawls 's argument as a justification for capitalism since even the poorest members of society theoretically benefit from increased innovations under capitalism ; others believe only a strong welfare state can satisfy Rawls 's theory of justice .

The capabilities approach – sometimes called the human development approach – looks at income inequality and poverty as form of “ capability deprivation ” . Unlike neoliberalism , which “ defines well-being as utility maximization ” , economic growth and income are considered a means to an end rather than the end itself . Its goal is to “ wid [ en ] people ’ s choices and the level of their achieved well-being ” through increasing functionings ( the things a person values doing ) , capabilities ( the freedom to enjoy functionings ) and agency ( the ability to pursue valued goals ) .

When a person ’ s capabilities are lowered , they are in some way deprived of earning as much income as they would otherwise . An old , ill man can not earn as much as a healthy young man ; gender roles and customs may prevent a woman from receiving an education or working outside the home . There may be an epidemic that causes widespread panic , or there could be rampant violence in the area that prevents people from going to work for fear of their lives . As a result , income and economic inequality increases , and it becomes more difficult to reduce the gap without additional aid . To prevent such inequality , this approach believes it ’ s important to have political freedom , economic facilities , social opportunities , transparency guarantees , and protective security to ensure that people aren ’ t denied their functionings , capabilities , and agency and can thus work towards a better relevant income .

University of Chicago scholars have played a major role in the development of various academic disciplines , including : the Chicago school of economics , the Chicago school of sociology , the law and economics movement in legal analysis , the Chicago school of literary criticism , the Chicago school of religion , and the behavioralism school of political science . Chicago 's physics department helped develop the world 's first man-made , self-sustaining nuclear reaction beneath the university 's Stagg Field . Chicago 's research pursuits have been aided by unique affiliations with world-renowned institutions like the nearby Fermilab and Argonne National Laboratory , as well as the Marine Biological Laboratory . The university is also home to the University of Chicago Press , the largest university press in the United States . With an estimated completion date of 2020 , the Barack Obama Presidential Center will be housed at the university and include both the Obama presidential library and offices of the Obama Foundation .

Founded by the American Baptist Education Society with a donation from oil magnate and wealthiest man in history John D. Rockefeller , the University of Chicago was incorporated in 1890 ; William Rainey Harper became the university 's first president in 1891 , and the first classes were held in 1892 . Both Harper and future president Robert Maynard Hutchins advocated for Chicago 's curriculum to be based upon theoretical and perennial issues rather than on applied sciences and commercial utility . With Harper 's vision in mind , the University of Chicago also became one of the 14 founding members of the Association of American Universities , an international organization of leading research universities , in 1900 .

The University of Chicago was created and incorporated as a coeducational , secular institution in 1890 by the American Baptist Education Society and a donation from oil magnate and philanthropist John D. Rockefeller on land donated by Marshall Field . While the Rockefeller donation provided money for academic operations and long-term endowment , it was stipulated that such money could not be used for buildings . The original physical campus was financed by donations from wealthy Chicagoans like Silas B. Cobb who provided the funds for the campus ' first building , Cobb Lecture Hall , and matched Marshall Field 's pledge of $ 100,000 . Other early benefactors included businessmen Charles L. Hutchinson ( trustee , treasurer and donor of Hutchinson Commons ) , Martin A. Ryerson ( president of the board of trustees and donor of the Ryerson Physical Laboratory ) Adolphus Clay Bartlett and Leon Mandel , who funded the construction of the gymnasium and assembly hall , and George C. Walker of the Walker Museum , a relative of Cobb who encouraged his inaugural donation for facilities .

In the 1890s , the University of Chicago , fearful that its vast resources would injure smaller schools by drawing away good students , affiliated with several regional colleges and universities : Des Moines College , Kalamazoo College , Butler University , and Stetson University . In 1896 , the university affiliated with Shimer College in Mount Carroll , Illinois . Under the terms of the affiliation , the schools were required to have courses of study comparable to those at the university , to notify the university early of any contemplated faculty appointments or dismissals , to make no faculty appointment without the university 's approval , and to send copies of examinations for suggestions . The University of Chicago agreed to confer a degree on any graduating senior from an affiliated school who made a grade of A for all four years , and on any other graduate who took twelve weeks additional study at the University of Chicago . A student or faculty member of an affiliated school was entitled to free tuition at the University of Chicago , and Chicago students were eligible to attend an affiliated school on the same terms and receive credit for their work . The University of Chicago also agreed to provide affiliated schools with books and scientific apparatus and supplies at cost ; special instructors and lecturers without cost except travel expenses ; and a copy of every book and journal published by the University of Chicago Press at no cost . The agreement provided that either party could terminate the affiliation on proper notice . Several University of Chicago professors disliked the program , as it involved uncompensated additional labor on their part , and they believed it cheapened the academic reputation of the university . The program passed into history by 1910 .
